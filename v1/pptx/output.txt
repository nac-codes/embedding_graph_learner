Q) What qualities in Alexander strike you as unique, exceptional, or critical to the success of his conquests?

-> Now let’s problematize those… Where does that picture of A. come from? Are our sources consistent in depicting it? When we look at actions, rather than representations, does the picture change?

Military History of Alexander: How to Write it?
Innovations (Philip and Alexander):
Cavalry as main attacking unit (Product of social conditions – Landed Aristocracy)
Ratio of cavalry/infantry (Product of social conditions – Landed Aristocracy)
Sarissa phalanx (Product of professionalization, land reforms)
Combined arms -> specialist roles of phalanx, hypaspists, light-armed troops (Agrianians, Archers), cavalry (Theban influence)
Siege technology -> catapults + specialists (Carthaginian/Sicilian influence)
Abortively: the introduction of the war elephant (Persian/Indian influence)

*But some of these were only innovations in the Greek world; Persian armies also drew upon cavalry as their primary forces, and featured a professional infantry core (melophoroi, ‘Immortals’)

Social Structure and Warfare:
The vast majority of Macedonian society was composed of tenant farmers and pastoralists dependent on aristocratic land-owners.
The aristocracy was both the bureaucracy of the state and the core of the cavalry -> the king’s companions (hetairoi).
The sarissa phalanx, the “foot-companions” (pezhetairoi) may have acquired their name via land reforms of Philip which gave them parcels of land and made them loyal to the king.
Even if more of the Macedonian infantry were land-owners, in Alexander’s campaign specifically they became in effect a professionalized corps.

What worlds did Alexander occupy?

First:
Aristocratic/Royal Macedonian Culture
Greek Cultural Education
Why the intense emphasis on Homeric World?

Cultural Geography, or, the Worlds of Alexander
Alexander and the Greeks

Throughout his campaign, Alexander held games and festivals in the Greek tradition, and was accompanied by a variety of Greek cultural figures (Callisthenes, the sophist Anaxarchus, various Olympic champions). 

Alexander carefully controlled his representation in visual arts, apparently only allowing the painter Apelles and sculptor Lysippus to represent him (at least in the Greek world)

He was obviously deeply impacted by his reading in the Greek tradition, particularly with Homer, but also with philosophy (anecdotes re: Diogenes, Calanus)

There is no doubt that Alexander’s conquests laid the groundwork for the rapid and distant spread of Greek culture, e.g. in Egypt, Syria, Bactria, even India. But what indications do we have that this was anything like a deliberate policy?

A very selective approach to Greek historical memory: remember Macedonia sided with the Persians during the Persian wars!
Cultural Geography, or, the Worlds of Alexander
Alexander and the Greeks

For all his embrace of Greek culture, it was also idiosyncratic: the Homeric heroes were fundamental cultural touchstones, but also completely incompatible with democratic ideology.

The historical figure that Alexander most emulated, and was most comparable to, was obviously Cyrus the Great!

Alexander’s treatment of Greek cities was a matter of pragmatism: the destruction of Thebes was a reminder that there was to be no challenge to Macedonian domination.

The justifications of the League of Corinth fall away over the course of the campaign, and his death is immediately followed by rebellion led by Athens and the Aetolians.

Individual Greek cities were dealt with in different ways: some invented connections to Alexander in later history, others had dealings with Alexander documented in inscriptions which are not mentioned at all in the Alexander historians.

An important note: aside from Alexander himself, we lack a Macedonian view.

Alexander and Athens

After Granicus (Arrian 1.16.7)
…the prisoners were sent in chains to Macedonia to hard labour, because though Greeks they had violated the common resolutions of the Greeks by fighting with barbarians against Greece. He sent to Athens three hundred Persian panoplies to be set up to Athena in the acropolis; he ordered this inscription to be attached: ‘Alexander son of Philip and the Greeks, except the Lacedaemonians, set up these spoils from the barbarians dwelling in Asia’

Before Gaugamela (Arrian 3.6.2)
“At Tyre he sacrificed a second time to Heracles and held athletic and musical games. There the Paralus from Athens reached him, bringing Diophantus and Achilles as envoys; the entire crew of the Paralus were associated with them in the embassy. They achieved all the objects of their mission; in particular Alexander gave up to the Athenians all the Athenians captured at the Granicus.”

The Exiles’ Decree (324)
- A direct contravention of the League of Corinth’s terms; deliberately weakening Athens by undermining their colony on Samos. Pre/Post Campaign changes evident.

Cultural Geography, or, the Worlds of Alexander
Alexander and the Persian Empire

Arrian 2.14.1-2:
*While Alexander was still at Marathus, envoys reached him from Darius, bringing a letter from him… The letter argued as follows: Philip had been in peace and alliance with Artaxerxes, and when Arses son of Artaxerxes became king, Philip first did wrong to King Arses, although he had sustained no injury from the Persians.

Problems:
Persians stereotyped in long Greek tradition: decadence, luxury, cruelty, unmanliness, tyranny.
Even contemporary sources who were with Alexander influenced by pre-existing Greek representations of Persians: Herodotus, Xenophon -> These established representations of the ‘barbarian’ other contaminate our sources at every level (e.g. (especially) Arrian’s portrait of Darius III).
No Persian historiography as a counterpoint: only scraps of coinage, administrative documents, archaeology (and these esp. scarce under Darius III).
Even modern scholarship (if not so much current scholarship) has been deeply impacted by ancient prejudices, ”west” vs. “east”; “civilizing” etc.

Cultural Geography, or, the Worlds of Alexander
Alexander and the Persian Empire: Scholarship:

Old:
Persian empire as decadent and weak
Darius as cowardly
Un-critical adoption of Greek/Roman biases
Buy-in to “war of liberation”
Alexander as “civilizer”
Alexander’s ”Persianization” as personal flaw
Greek freedom vs. Persian tyranny

New:
Persian empire as dynamic and resurgent in 2nd half of 4th century
Darius as energetic and innovative defender of his empire
A critical awareness of propaganda and biases of sources
Definition of A.’s campaign as expansionist war
Alexander as strategic political pragmatist, not “Persia-lover”
Alexander didn’t destroy the Persian empire, he conquered it
Contradictions in idea that war was about Greek freedom

Cultural Geography, or, the Worlds of Alexander
Case Study: Persepolis

Supposedly a strong exception to Alexander’s growing policy of appeasement/conciliation with Persian aristocracy.

Sources exaggerate the Greek symbolism of destruction of Persepolis Royal palace (Thaïs the Athenian) -> Archaeology shows it was a controlled and deliberate act.

While it might read one way to a Greek audience, the act also had several readings to a Persian audience:
An attempt to intimidate Darius and his supporters
Preventing any rival from claiming the existing throne
Perhaps signaling a return to the Teispid royal line (Cyrus the Great, before Darius I)




Week 4B: The Indian Campaign; The Battle of the Hydaspes; “Mutiny” at the Hyphasis (327-326 BCE)
The ‘Elephant Medallion’; decadrachm minted at Babylon c.324 BCE 

Where We Left Off:
*Bactria/Sogdiana pacified over 329-327:
Irregular Warfare; Mountain warfare
Securing Existing satrapies but also frontier regions
A Marked increase in punitive tactics on the part of Alexander
The resistance came from provinces that were well integrated in Achaemenid empire, with allies from beyond

*Flare-ups of discontent and suppression of (perceived) threats:
Philotas and Parmenion
Cleitus the Black
Conspiracy of the Pages
Callisthenes

*As Alexander marched out of Bactra in early summer of 327, his stated goal was the conquest of India (not to be confused with the very large modern nation); unlike in the previous years, the campaign involved confrontation with local rulers (SE of the Hindu Kush) who were either recently independent from, or never a part of, the Achaemenid empire.

*Some Indian rulers, notably Taxiles (territory on the east bank of the Indus), had already approached Alexander with offers of alliance while he was in the north (Diodorus 17.86).
The March to the Indus River
*After re-crossing the Hindu Kush, the first resistance was found in the (former) satrapy of Gandhara (the region around Peshawar). 

*There is no evidence that there had been a Persian satrap in the region at this time; it had been under Persian control in the time of Darius I, but was almost certainly independent at the time of A.’s arrival (but note Persian influence in the Indian contingents sent to Gaugamela).

*After departing from Alexandria in the Caucasus (modern Bagram), Alexander split the army into two columns: 
One under Hephaestion and Perdiccas took the Kyber pass to the city of Peucelaotis (mod. Charsadda), securing the main road into the region.

The other half with Alexander (notably the more mobile hypaspists and Agrianians) stuck to the mountains north of the Kabul river. Resistance in the region from the Aspasians and then the Assacenians, using mountain hideaways and fortified cities. 

*Bosworth (Alexander and the East, pg. 26): “The act of killing meant little, and it can be shown that the level of violence escalated as a direct response to resistance during the grim campaigns in the north-east and India… The frightfulness increased as he moved on India. Massacre and enslavement was the policy against settlements which stood siege…”
 
Map of Central Asia and route to Indus (Heckel 2020)

*There was no central power co-ordinating resistance to Alexander: each local ruler (hyparch, in Arrian) and city had to be dealt with individually, with some resisting and others seeing A.’s ruthlessness and submitting.

*The force under Hephaestion and Perdiccas was instructed to make their way to the Indus and prepare a boat bridge for the river crossing, alongside Taxiles and other local leaders. The leader in Peucelaotis, a certain Astis, resisted and was besieged for 30 days. 

*Alexander, meanwhile, made a terrible example of the first city to resist: A. was lightly wounded, and after taking the city, the Macedonians killed all those who were fleeing, finally burning the city to the ground.

*The next city, Andaca, surrendered; Craterus appointed to deal with any neighboring cities showing resistance.

*Next to a city (the name is lost), “where the hyparch of the Aspasians was” (Arrian 4.24.1); but instead of defending the city, the inhabitants burned it and retreated to the mountains, where A. hunted down anyone fleeing.

*Arrian (4.24.3-5) reports that Ptolemy risked death to kill the leader of the Aspasians.
*Next, another city (Arigaeum) is burned in retreat. Alexander deemed the site ideal for a settlement, and had it fortified and settlers brought in from surrounding areas (Arrian 4.24.7)
-> Note the recurring strategy: garrison, settlement, control of restless areas

*A. pursues the remaining Aspasians into the hills. Ptolemy reports 40,000 men captured after fierce fighting (unlikely).

*A first glimpse of Alexander the ‘explorer’, ‘natural historian’: thousands of oxen seized, and given their impressive size, examples sent back to Macedonia.

*After the Aspasians came the Assacenians: more running to the hills, siege of the principal city of Massaga -> eventual surrender with offer to join A.’s army -> Arrian (4.27.4) reports that the surrendered fighters planned to slip away in the night and were massacred.

*After another siege, the inhabitants of Bazira fled their city to the mountain top called Aornos in our Greek sources…


Aornos (Greek “birdless”), probably corresponding with the modern Pir Sar mountain, perhaps a rendering of the Old Indian Avarana “hiding place”.

* Arrian (4.28) reports that it was believed that Herakles failed 
to storm this mountain (he is skeptical); but upon learning this, 
“a longing seized” Alexander to take the mountain-top fortress.

* The mountain was associated in local legend with the Hindu 
deity Krishna (=Herakles?).

* First he fortifies several captured cities as forts, and appoints a 
satrap, Nicanor, over the region west of the Indus river.

* Arrian (4.29) says Ptolemy was given a command to seize a key
position with the help of local guides (absent from other sources)

*Arrian: brave and brilliant siege tactics, several days hard fighting
Diodorus (17.85): a much shorter version, no Ptolemy.

* After neutralizing resistance centered on Aornos, A. was able to take control of the Assacenian territories.
The Siege of the Birdless Rock (Spring 326)
Nysa
* Treated by Arrian (5.1) outside of the chronological sequence: a showpiece to begin Book 5?
Plutarch (58) only treats a brief anecdote from the Nysan embassy to A. (a certain Acouphis), no Dionysus story

* Alexander arrives at the city called Nysa, which was supposed to have been founded by Dionysus after his conquest of India (an ‘agnostic’ approach from Arrian 5.1.2).

* The Nysan ambassador begs A. to spare the city on the grounds of its holy associations, and A. is pleased with the idea of going farther than Dionysus had -> Many aspects of Nysa represented as Greek: Dionysus, Aristocratic government, “independence” (eleutheria), rhetorical persuasion of the ambassador.

Arrian (5.2.1): “He thought that the Macedonians would not be so reluctant to follow him on arduous campaigns still further on if they were spurred on by the ambition to surpass Dionysus’ achievements.”

*We should keep this episode in mind when we turn to the end of the line at the Hyphasis river: Arrian particularly insistent on Alexander’s desires to push further and further.

A Digression on “India”
Arrian (5.4.3): “In this history I have deliberately omitted any account of the customs and institutions of the Indians, of any strange fauna their country produces, of the size and nature of the fish or other monsters found in the Indus, Hydaspes, Ganges, or other Indian rivers, of the ants that mine their gold or the griffins that guard it, or of all the other fabrications people have made up as sensational stories rather than descriptions of reality, in the certainty that no one was likely to disprove any far-fetched falsehood peddled about India and the Indians.”

-> Arrian does often depict Alexander the explorer (e.g. 6.1.2, A. believes he has discovered the source of the Nile river because of crocodiles in the Indus).

Richard Stoneman, The Greek Experience of India: “Every age has had its own picture of India, always from the vantage point of an observer who finds what he observes essentially alien. Yet the otherness of India exerts a pull, a fascination, which naturally results in a particularly strong distortion of reality to fit what the observer thinks he sees, wishes to see, or believes he ought to see. In order to understand how Greeks such as Megasthenes saw India, it is necessary to peel back these curtains or at least to be aware of the distorting, pixillating effect each separate one has on our field of vision.”

Q) Where have you observed Stoneman’s “distorting, pixillating” effect in our primary source readings this week?
Taxiles and Porus
With the hill country secured, and after much violence there, A. made his way to the Indus river and crossed, by means of a boat bridge prepared in advance by Hephaestion and Perdiccas.

He was first met by the king Taxiles (actually soon-to-be, at the time a prince named Omphis); Taxiles brought lavish gifts and was confirmed as a vassal king by Alexander.

Taxiles must have had his principal enemies, Porus and Abisares in mind when he visited Alexander in Sogdiana.

Alexander did appoint a satrap over the new territory east of the Indus river, Philip, son of Machatas; it is not clear how the relationship between satrap and king would work, as this was a new approach.

From the city of Taxila, Alexander secured submission from Abisares via envoys, but Porus made clear that he would meet A. in battle, and had a large army waiting on the opposite banks of the Hydaspes (Jhelum) river. 
The Battle of the Hydaspes (Late Spring 326)
The confrontation with Porus brought several challenges: the Hydaspes was a deep, fast-flowing river (esp. in summer), and Porus had a strong elephant division, the likes of which A. had not yet faced.

Alexander prepared by shipping the boat bridge from the Indus, and gave the impression that he was preparing to cross at low water in the autumn.

Arrian (5.10) describes how Alexander pretended to be making maneuvers every night, which Porus would track until finally becoming complacent with no attacks occurring. 

The river crossing involved a series of diversions, and ultimately Alexander would face Porus’ army with only the elite troops that he took across himself. This must mean that the numbers in Porus’ army were (surprise!) exaggerated in our sources (Arrian 5.15.5: 4,000 cavalry, 300 chariots, 200 elephants, 30,000 infantry). Alexander’s actual fighting force was only 6,000 infantry and 5,000 cavalry.

But despite questions about Porus’ numbers, A.’s tactics were brilliantly executed, and the river crossing went unopposed, forcing Porus to back up his army into a defensive position.

Macedonian success still depended on a strategy for facing Porus’ elephants (whatever the number): the key lay in the long sarissa spears of the phalanx, which could dismount the drivers and send the elephants into a panic.

From Bosworth, Alexander and the East (pg. 17)
The aftermath of the battle is one of the famous episodes in Alexander’s campaign: 

Arrian 5.18.4: “Porus had played a distinguished role in the battle, not only as commander-in-chief, but as a fine soldier… unlike the great king Darius he did not give way and start a general flight by his own example…”

Arrian 5.18.6: “Alexander dearly wanted to save the life of a great man he had seen fight a noble battle. So he first sent out Taxiles the Indian to reason with him. Taxiles rode up as close as he thought safe to the elephant carrying Porus, and asked him to halt the animal, as there was no escape, and listen to Alexander’s proposals. Seeing an old enemy in Taxiles, Porus made for him with javelin in hand: and he could well have killed him…”

Alexander sends several men to talk down Porus, finally succeeding with an old friend, who brought him to A.



 
Porus
Arrian 5.19: “He reined in his horse and gazed for a while at Porus, struck by the size of the man (he was over seven and a half feet tall), his handsome looks, and the way he seemed quite unbroken in spirit, more like one brave man meeting another after an honourable battle for his kingdom with another king. Alexander was the first to speak. 

He asked Porus to say what he wished to be done with him, and Porus is said to have replied: “Treat me, Alexander, like a king”. Pleased with this answer, Alexander said “For myself, Porus, I shall do as you ask: tell me know now what you expect for yourself”. Porus replied that everything was contained in that one request. Yet more impressed by this answer, Alexander granted Porus continued rule over his Indian kingdom and added to its original extent further territory which more than doubled it. This was how he fulfilled his own commitment to treat a brave man “like a king”, and Porus’ response was complete loyalty thereafter.”

Plutarch (60) reports a shorter but similar version of the story, with less emphasis on the figure of Porus; he also makes clear that his expanded territory was included in Philip’s satrapy.

Q) So is Porus a king, or a vassal under a Macedonian satrap? Is Plutarch mistaken about the territory under Philip, or is Arrian exaggerating Porus’ continued kingship?

*In 325, Philip was assassinated (Arrian 6.27), and his satrapy was divided (provisionally) between Taxiles and Eudamas. But Arrian also says later that Philip’s territory was west of the Indus, and that Porus was announced king of all acquired Indian territory (6.2.3 ; 6.2.1).
Porus
Shortly after the battle of the Hydaspes, Alexander’s horse Bucephalas died (Arrian 5.19.5-6; Plutarch 61) -> Alexander then founded two settlements on the Hydaspes, one named Nicaea (Nikaia) = “victory”, another named Bucephala (neither site has been found).

This is in fact Arrian’s only mention of Alexander’s famous horse, and here notes that nobody else could mount him (cf. Plutarch’s story of the young Alexander).


Bucephalas (Bucephalus)
The Good Porus and the Bad Porus
Arrian’s account of the aftermath of the battle with Porus is unique: he is the only author to explicitly compare Porus and Darius III, suggesting a bigger meditation on kingship (Howe).

This becomes more clear when Arrian compares the first Porus, and another Porus, Πώρος ὁ κακός, “the bad Porus” (5.21). This “bad Porus” is said to have made offers of surrender to Alexander before the Hydaspes battle, but fled after A. and the “Good” Porus came to terms.

Only in Arrian does this “bad” Porus play such a large role, and it is Ptolemy who is crucial in defeating him. It is these pursuits that ultimately bring the army to the Hyphasis (Beas) river (also a bloody campaign against the Cathaeans, with the siege of Sangala, only documented at length in Arrian (5.23-24).
The ”Mystery of the Elephant Medallions” (Frank Holt)
Probably produced at Babylon under Mazaeus
Aristeia: awards for merit in military service
How does the imagery of the coins conflict with the accounts
of our sources?

What next? Alexander had now secured the previous borders of the Persian empire at the Indus, and established client kings beyond under a new, expanded, satrapy (?).
But at the partition of Babylon (323, after Alexander’s death), Taxiles and Porus held their expanded territories, not as satraps but as (vassal) kings.

What does Alexander’s response to resistance in the region say about his approach to empire-building? (cf. Sogdiana, another frontier region)

What distorting effects does the region of “India” have on our accounts? Can we peel back the layers of distortion to understand A.’s goals in the region?


 
Issues
The End of the Line
*Diodorus (17.89.5): “His plan was to get to the end of India, subduing all the inhabitants of the country on the way, and then to sail down to the Ocean.”
Statement comes after the defeat of Porus; ship-building on the Indus river(!)
Typically taken to refer to modern India, with an exit at the Bay of Bengal (distortion?)
Diodorus’ statement describes exactly what Alexander actually did!

*Arrian (5.25.2): “It was also reported that these Indians in the east (i.e. of the Hyphasis) had a far greater number of elephants than elsewhere in India, and that their elephants were distinguished for their great size and courage. These reports spurred in Alexander a desire to press on further. But the Macedonian’s spirits were flagging by now…”
This clearly refers to a campaign into modern India
Alexander then addresses his troops in a long speech in direct quotation (5.25.3-26.8), urging them on to this new phase of campaigning.
Coenus speaks on behalf of the troops, who applaud (5.27)
Ptolemy says that Alexander makes sacrifices on the Hyphasis, and they are inauspicious (5.28.4); after this Alexander concedes to end the campaign; 12 altars built on the Hyphasis.

*Plutarch (62): “Another consequence of this battle with Porus was that it blunted the edge of the Macedonians’ courage and made them determined not to advance any farther into India… At first, Alexander was so overcome with disappointment and anger that he shut himself up and lay in his tent.” (Plutarch confuses the Hyphasis and the Ganges, which doesn’t help!)
The End of the Line
W. Heckel,’ Alexander the Great and the ’limits of the world’ (pg. 166): “We need only look at Alexander’s own actions and preparations in order to see that the proposed invasion of India (i.e. modern India) was a sham. The clearest indications that Alexander believes he has completed the conquest of the Persian empire, and thus achieved his goal, are the sacrifices at the Hydaspes and the building of the Indus fleet. These are clearly spelled out in the popular tradition but Arrian’s account obscures Alexander’s true intentions somewhat, and I believe this obfuscation is deliberate.”

More Problems:
What did ancient writers even mean by “India”?
A. likely had no knowledge of the Indian subcontinent before meeting figures like Taxiles.
If he intended to march across the subcontinent to the eastern ocean, why leave vassal kings like Taxiles and Porus in his line of communications?
Arrian, despite being generally most reliable, still prone to hero worship… Alexander’s speech at the Hyphasis a cover story?
Wouldn’t it make more sense that Alexander was doing the exact same thing as in the upper satrapies? -> Pacify and secure restless provinces, create buffer zones beyond borders.
A campaign to the Ganges and beyond would take Alexander against a totally new empire (Nanda); indeed soon, under Chandragupta Maurya, a formidable empire would reconquer all of this territory.
Greek/Roman/Modern Historiography: Uncomfortable with Alexander, Great King, King of Kings?


The End of the Line
*This is what is commonly described as the “mutiny” at the Hyphasis river; even if Arrian’s account is not a pure fabrication, would this amount to mutiny?

*Do we trust Arrian and his carefully polished speeches? Or Diodorus and his matter of fact account? 
- Diodorus does allude elsewhere to some of what is in Arrian: A. wanted to march against the Gandaridae ( 17.93.4) across the Ganges (Nanda empire), but knew it would be difficult; A. gave a speech to his men but failed to convince them (17.94).

*Ultimately, our understanding of this episode may come down to our own preconceptions about Alexander, and the distorting effect of subsequent colonial histories (esp. British empire).

*What do YOU think?
Going “Home”
*The end of the campaign of conquest was not quite at hand though, A. and his army worked their way down the river system, on the way facing resistance from several peoples, notably the Mallians and Oxydracae.

Winter 326/325: A. splits the army in three, with two contingents marching and one sailing down the Hydaspes.

*The general approach was clear: split up the army into multiple contingents to catch enemies by surprise as they moved locations and retreated. Next was one of the bloodiest seasons of the whole campaign, against the Mallian people.

Arrian (6.6.3): “So his onslaught took them by surprise, and he killed most of them without any resistance offered, unarmed as they were.”

*When these same Mallians took refuge and defended the citadel in one of their cities, everyone was killed (around 2,000).

*A series of blitzes and hunting down refugees in Mallian land, before arriving at the largest city in the area. 


Going “Home”
*In the assault on the city, at some point Alexander rushed in ahead of his men, and after doing much killing himself, was hit with an arrow that pierced his ribs (Arrian 6.10)

*A. was barely rescued, and Arrian reports that some historians say it was Perdiccas who did the emergency operation that would have saved his life (6.11.1).

*After Alexander recovered, the Macedonian terror campaign forced the remaining Mallians and the Oxydracae to offer submission, and A. enlisted 1,000 of their best fighters in his army. 

*Contrast with the treatment of Musicanus afterwards (Arrian 6.15.6-7): “This shock had him hurrying to meet Alexander, conveying the gifts most highly valued by the Indians… this last was the surest way for anyone to win concessions from Alexander, and so it proved in the approach taken by Musicanus.”

And then… 

After Darius: The Bactrian Campaign; Dissent, Conspiracy, and Murder (330-327 BCE) 
Relief with Proskynesis scene (Darius I), from the Apadana at Persepolis
Coin of Demetrios I, Greco-Bactrian Kingdom (early 2nd cent. BCE)

After Darius: The Conspiracy of (against?) Philotas  
*After Darius’ death there were clear tensions between Alexander and an unknown percentage of his army:
-> The Greek forces were sent home with pay.
-> A contingent (represented by Parmenion) clearly wanted an eastern frontier at the Euphrates river.
-> Plutarch (47) relates that these tensions were mentioned by Alexander in a letter to Antipater
-> Plutarch also states that it was at this junction that Alexander began to adapt more and more of his habits to Persian custom (esp. in a court setting), creating a division among those who approved and the traditionalists.

*Parmenion was away from the army in Media; but it was in this context that suspicions of disloyalty against he and his son Philotas came to a head…

*According to Ptolemy and Aristobulus (Arrian 3.26.1), reports of a plot against A. by Philotas had been known (and dismissed) since Egypt.

*But with the environment drastically changed, Philotas was questioned, and evidence supposedly brought forward of a plot which Philotas did nothing to stop.

*With his ‘trial’ over, Philotas and the conspirators were executed.
After Darius: The Conspiracy of (against?) Philotas  
*Philotas’ execution was a dangerous move: he was the commander of the companion cavalry, and his father was the most respected of Philip’s generation of the Macedonian army.

*A. sent for Parmenion to be assassinated in Media: Arrian allows two possibilities… 1) Parmenion must have known of his son’s plot, or 2) he simply couldn’t be allowed to live after the action against Philotas.

*There may have been a broader purge of people close to Philotas at the time (Arrian 3.27.1-3); Ptolemy in fact benefited from the whole affair, one of the somatophylakes (bodyguards), Demetrios, was also arrested, and Ptolemy took his place (3.27.5).

*A subsequent reorganization of the command structure: companion cavalry (hetairoi) to be split between Hephaestion and Cleitus (distribution of power).

*On the eve of the Bactrian campaign we thus have several crucial turning points:
Abandonment of original justification for war (League of Corinth)
A clear desire to rule the empire as Great King
Related tensions in the ranks, and a willingness to put them down on A.’s part

Q) What are the incentives to keep going?
 
After Darius: The Challenge of Bessus and the Bactrian Campaign (330-329)
*Alexander clearly had no intention of letting Bessus claim the kingship for himself in his province, and he set out on a campaign against him.

*At the very outset of the campaign, some major problems emerged: 
Satibarzanes, who was re-appointed satrap of Areia after surrendering to Alexander, launched a revolt there. 
Satibarzanes may have planned this revolt all along, if he was indeed the one who reported to Alexander that Bessus had adopted the title and imagery of king in Bactria (QC 6.6.13)

*But Bessus and Satibarzanes’ rebellions also gave A. an opportunity, to play the avenger of Darius (quite a turn from 334!). Arrian (3.21.10) reports that Satibarzanes was one of the men who killed Bessus; we don’t see this elsewhere, but may reflect A.’s later propaganda.

*A. quickly turned to pursue Satibarzanes in Areia, taking half of his army on a rapid two-day march: Satibarzanes escaped with a small group, and Alexander set about punishing anyone suspected of joining his rebellion (3.25.7). Then another satrap, Arsaces, was appointed there.



After Darius: The Challenge of Bessus and the Bactrian Campaign (329)
*It was presumably a lesson for Alexander: instead of resuming the march into Bactria, he rejoined the army and marched for Drangiana, where another of Bessus’ killers, Barsaentes was satrap.

*Barsaentes fled to India, but evidently was sent back to Alexander, who had him executed (this was actually 3 years later!).

*It was here at Phrada in Drangiana where Philotas was tried and executed.

*From here the march against Bessus resumed, with A. securing the surrender of the provinces of Gedrosia and Arachosia, appointing Menon as satrap with a garrison. Only to find out that Satibarzanes was back in Areia with forces supplied by Bessus. An army under Artabazus and two Companions was sent to deal with the revolt and Satibarzanes is killed in battle.

*On the march north into Bactria through the Hindu Kush mountain range, Arrian tells us that A. founded another Alexandria at Mt. Caucasus (modern Bagram, N. of Kabul in Afghanistan).
-> Diodorus (17.83) gives evidence that this Alexandria, and surely many others, were essentially garrisons with a settler population imported (veterans, non-Macedonians, mercenary volunteers).
After Darius: The Challenge of Bessus and the Bactrian Campaign (329)
*Bessus prepared for A. by devastating the crops north of the mountains; but he had not united the region in defense and did not have the numbers to actually face A.’s army.

*Retreat into Sogdiana, N. of the Oxus river (Amu Darya, ~Modern Uzbekistan/Tajikistan) : recruitment for guerilla warfare against Alexander, incl. nomadic Saca peoples.

*This meant A. was able to sieze Bactria without fighting, and install garrisons and Artabazus as satrap. By summer 329, A. would march to the Oxus short on supplies and food, and cross the river on makeshift rafts (no boats or timber).

*Two Sogdian nobles came to A., reporting that they would turn Bessus over (dissent on his side too); Arrian (via Ptolemy) recounts Ptolemy’s initiative to secure the handover (Arrian 3.30.1-3); but Diodorus (17.83) reports a simple handover, and Arrian later notes that Aristobulus agrees with the latter version (3.30.5).

*A. would hold on to Bessus to get the maximum effect out of his execution; he was mutilated in a punishment with precedence for attempted usurpers in the Achaemenid empire, and shipped off to Ecbatana for a public execution.

 
Sogdiana (Summer 329-Summer 328)
*Quintus Curtius (7.5.28-35) alone reports the story that Alexander and his army massacred a town somewhere in Sogdiana in the process of seizing Bessus. This town was inhabited by the disgraced descendants of the Branchidae, from Miletus, who handed over the temple of Didyma to Xerxes in 479 BCE.
Looting and murder justified by righting a historic wrong
Omitted by Ptolemy and Aristobulus (maybe he really wasn’t there?); story is from the Vulgate tradition, but that doesn’t mean fictional.
A retroactive justification for an episode of frustrated violence?

*As A. made his way to the Jaxartes river (Syr-Darya), he once again chooses a site for a city foundation (Alexandria Eschate), a strategic outpost for dealing with Scythian nomads beyond the borders of the empire (Arrian 4.1).

*In the process he learns of a revolt across Sogdiana, and besieges the city of Cyropolis, first taking four other cities, in successive days, each time plundering the city, killing the men, and enslaving the women and children (Arrian 4.2).

*This resistance was led by Spitamenes, one of the Sogdian leaders who handed Bessus over to Alexander. 
 
Sogdiana (Summer 329 – Summer 328)
*The revolt in Sogdiana is very difficult to understand or even reconstruct… the important points are:
This was a series of small attacks, raids, and general guerilla warfare. The term “insurgency” has often been used, but that assumes that this was a rebellion against Alexander’s legitimate rule, rather than resistance to an invading force.

Q) How might the history of the modern world impact our understanding of this difficult period of Alexander’s campaign?

The geography of the region was difficult, particularly as a border zone with nomadic peoples beyond the Syr-Darya -> groups of Scythians repeatedly joined Spitamenes’ efforts at resistance (mercenaries? ‘state’ actors? What is their interest in this fight?)

- The enemy was not new, and there were some precedents for the fighting (hills, e.g. in Balkans, against the Uxians); but the larger strategic elements were new for this campaign: multiple fronts, retreat and regroup.

- Much of Alexander’s diplomacy at this time was with independent kings beyond the borders of the empire. We can see an attempt at creating buffer-zones at a time of uncertainty.
Samarkand (Winter 328)
*There were still elements of resistance across Sogdiana, and Spitamenes was still at large. But many of Alexander’s forces would convene at Samarkand in the early winter.

*At a drunken party, Cleitus (the Black), was killed by Alexander. Sources of the episode vary in the details, but:
There was a lot of flattery of Alexander being thrown around, and putting down the achievements of his father Philip.
Cleitus, an ‘old-school’ Macedonian, spoke up. He may have been disgruntled by a ‘demotion’ from cavalry command to satrapy of Bactria/Sogdiana.
In the course of a verbal altercation, Alexander grabbed a weapon and killed Cleitus. In the aftermath, most of our sources report that A. intended to kill himself, but was restrained, and then grieved for several days.
The killing of Cleitus was not as politically significant as that of Philotas and Parmenion, but it was perhaps another expression of the same tensions.

*Over the course of that winter, Sitamenes scored some victories and defeats, and in the end was killed by his Massagetae allies, with his head being sent to A. (Arrian 4.17.7).



Out of the Upper Satrapies (Winter 328 - Summer 327)
*After two years of resistance in Bactria/Sogdiana, Alexander could finally look beyond immediate concerns, and south to India.

*Some new policies were implemented: 
A much larger army than any previous garrisons was left behind in Bactria with its new satrap Amyntas (~10,000 infantry, 3,500 cavalry).
Colonization began to play a crucial role in pacifying conquered territory.
30,000 Bactrian youths were conscripted to be trained in Macedonian phalanx warfare .

*This period also brought several significant events for A. on the personal and political fronts:
In early spring of 327, A. married a girl from the Bactrian nobility, Roxane. This was obviously in part political (cf. Philip!), but it is significant that she was Alexander’s first wife.
Around the same time, A. began to experiment with proskynesis: this was a completely secular act of prostration to a superior (esp. the Great King) in Persian society. But in Greek culture it was an act reserved for gods. 
The protest against this practice is centered on Callisthenes in our sources (esp. Arrian 4.10-12, in a lengthy set of speeches). Callisthenes must have been voicing a widely-held resentment, and soon after was arrested and executed, ostensibly for being implicated in the conspiracy of the pages (Arrian 4.14, citing Ptolemy and Aristobulus vs. Vulgate tradition of innocence).
The Conspiracy of the Pages (Spring 327)
*Following the public drama with Callisthenes, another conspiracy against Alexander’s life was uncovered, this time it was much more likely to be real (source unanimity).

*One Hermolaus was identified as the ringleader: he had previously been publicly humiliated after a violation of protocol on a boar hunt with Alexander (Arrian 4.13.2), and gathered several people in a plot to kill A. in his sleep.

*For whatever reason, they didn’t go through with the plan, and the plot was exposed the next day. In Arrian’s account, it was Ptolemy who got word of the plot and relayed it to Alexander (4.13.7). 

*Those named were arrested and tortured for confessions; Arrian’s main sources say they also gave up the name of Callisthenes as the one who incited them. Plutarch seems to take the implication of Callisthenes quite personally, and says it is all slander (55).

*Every source seems to have a different version of what actually happened to Callisthenes after. Either he was actually part of the plot, or the plot represented a convenient moment to be rid of him as he had become too publicly critical of Alexander.

Issues
*A critical period for both the military and administrative evolution of Alexander’s conquest.

*Bactria/Sogdiana campaign is hopelessly entwined with modern histories of empire and resistance… can we hope to understand what Bessus and Spitamenes and their allies hoped to achieve?

*Alexander and the necessities of rule: was there any way to secure his rule over an empire that placed so much emphasis on the ruler, and at the same time keep his army on board?

*New problems, new solutions: settlements and colonization, extra-imperial diplomacy, management of boarder regions, new fighting tactics all adopted as necessities in a deeply changed environment. 

*Resentment, Dissent, Conspiracy: was there any solution to avoid alienating his army? Are these isolated episodes, or can we connect everything from Philotas and Parmenion to the pages and Callisthenes into a narrative?

*With so much trouble within the borders of the Achaemenid empire, why on earth would Alexander want to expand beyond them? (India; hints of future plans in his diplomacy with Chorasmian king, e.g.). 
Week 3A: The Battle of Gaugamela; Babylon; Persia (Summer 331-Winter 330 BCE)
Babylonian Astronomical Diary in Cuneiform, mentioning Gaugamela and Alexander’s entry into Babylon (British Museum)

Events: The Battle of Gaugamela: Summer/Autumn 331

When we left Alexander, he had rejected a diplomatic offer from Darius while staying at Tyre. There he celebrated a major festival featuring some of the super-stars of the Greek world.

An Athenian embassy came to Alexander there, and requested the freedom of the Greek prisoners taken after the Granicus, which he granted (remember Agis’ revolt, ‘The Lacedaemonian War’ is ongoing!)

Darius’ diplomacy, A second thought: (John Ma) -> Darius is actually quite inventive in his administration of empire; cutting his losses in the West may have been unprecedented, but this was a time of major convulsion and may represent some of his innovation as Great King.

The debate with Parmenion may be fictional(ized), but probably reflects growing tensions between Alexander and his army, esp. older figures like Parmenion (a major theme ahead!)

With diplomacy out the window, both sides prepared for the next major confrontation, which would take place at Gaugamela, in the north of Mesopotamia (modern Iraq).

Events: The Battle of Gaugamela: Summer/Autumn 331

Darius’ army was this time gathered at Babylon, drawing primarily on the satrapies to the east (Bactria, Sogdiana, Scythian (Saca) cavalry) and central regions of the empire.

With no large contingent of Greek mercenaries this time, the strength of the Persian army was entirely in its cavalry, which certainly outnumbered, and was in many parts probably superior to the Macedonian cavalry.

Numbers for Darius’ force are (once again) WILD:
Arrian (3.8.6): 1,000,000 infantry and 400,000 cavalry
Diodorus (17.53.3): >800,000 infantry and >200,000 cavalry
Plutarch (31): 1,000,000 men total
Quintus Curtius (4.12.13): 200,000 infantry and 45,000 cavalry

Alexander: ~40,000 Infantry and 7,000 cavalry (Arrian 3.12.5)

This makes it impossible to reconstruct, but it is safe to say that a) Alexander was outnumbered, and b) particularly on the cavalry side.

Q) Although the cavalry gathered in the Persian army was of a very high quality, what is the major problem with this approach (terrible infantry, great cavalry) against A.?


Events: The Battle of Gaugamela: Oct. 1st 331

Some Important Figures at Gaugamela (Persian Side):
Bessus -> Satrap of Bactria; would later kill Darius and claim the throne name of Artaxerxes V; commands the cavalry on the left flank at Gaugamela (facing A.).

Mazaeus -> Satrap of Syria (previously Cilicia); will be appointed satrap of Babylonia by Alexander; commands the cavalry on the right flank at Gaugamela (facing Parmenion).

Atropates -> Satrap of Media; a few years later will be re-appointed by A.; later father-in-law of Perdiccas, who will serve as regent for a time after A.’s death.

Artabazus -> Formerly satrap of Hellespontine Phrygia; remained loyal to Darius after Gaugamela, but later appointed to Bactria by A.

Ariarathes -> Satrap of Cappadocia, which was not conquered by A.; predecessor of later independent Cappadocian kingdom (3rd-1st cent. BCE)

Orontes -> Satrap of Armenia; his son Mithrenes (formerly satrap of Lydia) was fighting on the Macedonian side, and would be named satrap in his father’s place.
Events: The Battle of Gaugamela: Oct. 1st 331

Some Important Figures at Gaugamela (Macedonian Side):
Hephaestion -> “Patroclus” to A.’s Achilles; probably command of somatophylakes (bodyguards), who fought closely with A.

Parmenion -> Command of the left flank at Gaugamela; conservative foil to Alexander’s boldness in our sources.

Philotas -> Parmenion’s son, friend of A., and commander of the companion cavalry (hetairoi).

Ptolemy -> One of A.’s somatophylakes; future Ptolemy I Soter and Alexander historian.

Seleucus -> Commander of the hypaspists (hypaspistai), the mobile hoplite-style infantry that were crucial to Macedonian strategy; later Seleucus I Nikator.

Antigonus -> Macedonian satrap of Phrygia and later Antigonus I Monophthalmus.

Cleitus (the Black) -> Saved A.’s life at Granicus; later promoted to command of companion cavalry w/ Hephaestion; later to be murdered by A. in a drunken argument.

Events: The Battle of Gaugamela: Oct. 1st 331
The Short Version - Babylonian Astronomical Diary:

That month, the eleventh (=Sept 18th), panic occurred in the camp before the king [the Macedonians] encamped in front of the king.

The twenty-fourth (=Oct. 1st), in the morning, the king of the world [erected his] standard [lacuna]. Opposite each other they fought and a heavy defeat of the troops [of the king he inflicted].The king, his troops deserted him and to their cities [they went] They fled to the land of the Guti.

The Long Version:

*The Macedonian march into Mesopotamia was fast and uninterrupted; Alexander reached the Euphrates river in July/August 331 (probably actually early Sept.), where Mazaeus had been stationed to prevent a bridge crossing. He did not oppose the crossing of the main army, being outnumbered.

*After a rapid march, the Macedonian army crossed the Tigris on Sept. 18th; Darius was waiting in the wide-open plain at Gaugamela, but did not oppose the crossing.

Events: The Battle of Gaugamela: Oct. 1st 331

With no opposition, Alexander was able to camp for several days. Darius was not going to move because he had carefully prepared the battlefield, the rough patches smoothed out to allow his scythe chariots to maneuver.

After Darius’ army was spotted, Arrian (3.9.3-4) reports Alexander actually taking Parmenion’s advice for once, to scout the battlefield rather than rush in to the fight.

Arrian (3.9.11) also tells us that while the Macedonians camped and rested, the Persian army remained in formation overnight -> psychological damage? exhaustion before battle?

More prophecy associated with this battle: 
Callisthenes (Plut. 33) reported that before the battle Alexander prayed for help from Zeus and immediately an eagle was seen flying toward the Persian line (favoring an attack).
The seer Aristander had predicted (Arrian 3.15.7) that A. would win his battle in the same month as a lunar eclipse (seen after the crossing of the Tigris).

As Bosworth notes (pg. 81-2), the details of the battle are reported differently, and a comprehensive view of the battlefield would have been impossible because of the amount of dust
Events: The Battle of Gaugamela: Oct. 1st 331
The scale and conditions of the battle meant that each battalion and its commander was responsible for their own success -> communications between battalion commanders was essential.

Three accounts of Parmenion:
Arrian (3.10.1-2) -> “It is said” Parmenion advises A. to attack at night; A. refuses, must win an honorable open fight.
Arrian (3.15.1) -> Parmenion struggling on the left flank, sends messenger to A., who was pursuing the already fleeing Darius. Alexander receives message and charges to help, caught in heavy, slow fighting before he could reach Parmenion.
Plutarch (32) -> At the opening of the battle, Parmenion concerned about an attack on the baggage train, sends messenger to A., who responds with scorn and orders the attack on the right. Then later repeats Arrian’s scene, blaming Parmenion for Darius’ escape.
Plutarch (33): “In this battle, Parmenion is generally accused of having been sluggish and lacking in spirit, either because old age had dulled his courage, or because he had become envious of the authority and pomp, to use Callisthenes’ words, which Alexander now displayed.”
Diodorus (17.60.7) -> Parmenion sends to A. for help, but he couldn’t be reached and Parmenion fought bravely to hold the left flank.

Q) Can we now trace the source of anti-Parmenion bias in our sources? What might explain this particularly negative shift in the reporting of the battle?
Events: The Battle of Gaugamela: Oct. 1st 331
Arrian (3.14.3) – “the already fearful Darius could only see danger multiplied all around, and he was the first to turn and run.”

Astronomical Diary: “Opposite each other they fought and a heavy defeat of the troops [of the king he inflicted].The king, his troops deserted him and to their cities [they went] They fled to the land of the Guti.”

Q) Can we speculate on the most likely causes of the Macedonian victory at Gaugamela?

Whether he was quick or late to flee, Darius fled the battle along with Bessus and gathered men on his route to Ecbatana in Media, knowing Alexander would take the road to Babylon and Susa.

Mazaeus, meanwhile, fled for Babylon, where Alexander and his army would proceed over the next few weeks.

Post-Gaugamela: A Critical Juncture (Autumn 331)
How did the victory at Gaugamela impact the political and military situation?
Darius was still alive, and could (and would) prepare for another battle; nothing left to offer in diplomacy, but could still recruit from the upper satrapies w. Bessus.

Major reputational damage to Darius: A. was “King of the world” in Babylonian documents while Darius was still alive.

Susa and Babylon (and their massive treasuries) were won along with the battle.

Large contingent of reinforcements (c.15,000) arrive from Macedonia; army at least at its original strength.

The heartland of the Persian empire (Persis/Parsa) was still contested, but was without the Great King.

With Darius on the run, and the cities of Susa and Babylon his, how would Alexander deal with the administration of the Persian empire? 

And how would those solutions go over with his army/Greek support at home? How could he counter possible resistance?
Babylon and Susa (Autumn/Winter 331)
* Alexander proceeded to Babylon, where he was given a triumphal welcome and the city was handed over by Mazaeus.

*Similar to Egypt, Babylon had its own distinct conceptions of kingship, religious considerations, and some history of resistance to Achaemenid rule.

*But similarly, problems in historiography, bias against Achaemenid empire in (heavily classics-centric) scholarship.

*Arrian (3.16.3-5) gives a very brief explanation of the welcome at Babylon: A. rebuilt (allowed? ordered?) the temple of Bel-Marduk (the Esagila) destroyed by Xerxes; he met with Chaldaean priests and made sacrifices; he appointed Mazaeus as satrap (he had a Babylonian wife).
In short, he was welcomed as a benevolent alternative to Persian rule…

Problems: 
- The Esagila was not destroyed by Xerxes!
- Thus, there is no solid basis for assuming A. was welcomed as a ‘liberator’ (much as in our study of Egypt)
- Mazaeus may have had a Babylonian wife, but he was yet another Persian satrap!
Babylon and Susa (Autumn/Winter 331)
*Arrian (3.16.3) says Alexander advanced on the city in battle formation; he was at least prepared for resistance…

*Why did Mazaeus not resist? Probably for the same reason as most other cities in the same situation!

Babylonian Astronomical Diary:
That month, from the first to the [lacuna], came to Babylon, saying: "Esagila [will be restored] and the Babylonians to the treasury of Esagila [their tithe will give."]
On the eleventh, in Sippar an order of Al[exander to the Babylonians was sent as follow]s: "Into your houses I shall not enter.”
On the thirteenth, [the vanguard advanced to the Sikil]la gate, to the outer gate of Esagila and [the Babylonians prostrated themselves].
On the fourteenth, these Ionians a bull [lacuna] short, fatty tissue [lacuna]. Alexander, king of the world, came into Babylon [lacuna], horses and equipment of [lacuna] and the Babylonians and the people of [lacuna] a message to…. (End of Tablet)

Kuhrt: The “Re-building” of the Esagila was a ritual approval of Alexander’s kingship; it had not been destroyed, but was a ceremony to confirm and solemnize his rule (the Chaldaean rituals?)

Babylon and Susa (Autumn/Winter 331)
*In late Nov., Alexander departed for Susa, its surrender from the satrap Abulites already pre-arranged -> Susa was functionally the capital of the empire.

*Very similar welcome and procession as at Babylon; A. takes control of the treasury of 50,000 talents; this would subsidize Antipater’s war against Agis at home, and the rest of the campaign.

*Arrian (3.16.7-8) attributes to Alexander the return of the statues of Harmodius and Aristogeiton to Athens (the “tyrant-slayers”!); in reality this was probably done well after his death.

*A Greek festival is held at Susa; Abulites appointed satrap of Susiana, with a Macedonian garrison commander in the citadel.

*From Susa, A. heads SE into Parsa: he is met with resistance from the mountain-dwelling Uxians, who were not subject to a Persian satrap (and collected tolls even from the Great King!)

*Alexander gets a little (more) practice in mountain-fighting, no major setbacks. Before he could reach Persepolis however, A. had to deal with the satrap Ariobarzanes and a large army blocking the narrow mountain pass. Another brilliant, and hasty, victory!

Persepolis (Winter 331- Spring 330 BCE)

*Alexander and his army were welcomed into the capital of Persepolis by the citadel commander Tiridates (not much different from Susa, Babylon, and elsewhere), but the treatment of the city would be very different!

*Accounts of the incident vary:
Arrian (3.18.11-12): Very brief; Arrian says Alexander emptied the treasury and burnt the royal palace complex, against Parmenion’s advice. Attributes Alexander’s decision to punishment of Persian empire for past crimes, and Arrian himself states that this was wrong.
Diodorus (17.71.3): Attributes A.’s decision to burn the city (D., along with Quintus Curtius wrongly states that the whole city was burnt) to the hostility of the inhabitants.
Plutarch (38): Along with Diodorus, relates the story of a rowdy night of drinking after festivities held in Persepolis; both say that an Athenian woman named Thaïs made the suggestion to burn the palace down, and it was essentially a wild party that gave way to the revenge burning (Plut. does note that others claim it was Alexander’s policy).
Plutarch, unlike Diodorus, remarks that Thaïs was Ptolemy’s mistress, and future wife (yes that Ptolemy!)

Q) Can we untangle the source conflicts here? Which version is more likely?
Q) What are the pro’s and con’s (for Alexander) of this symbolic act of destruction?
The Death of Darius (July 330 BCE)
*A Persian satrap, Phrataortes, was appointed to Persis, the treasury was completely emptied and shipped off to Susa, Babylon, and elsewhere in a massive operation.

*After spending the winter in Persis/Parsa, Alexander began to march into Media, where Darius was gathering support in the city of Ecbatana.

*Darius left the city with Bessus and his Bactrian cavalry, and a handful of other satraps; in order to form another army he would need to go to the Upper satrapies of Bactria and Sogdiana to recruit. 

*Alexander split the army and left Parmenion to take control of Ecbatana and the rest of the province, while he took a smaller, faster force to pursue Darius.

*As Darius fled east, there must have been some tension; it is quite possible that he had never been in person to the upper satrapies, but Bessus (who was a family member) had been satrap in those regions, and may well command more loyalty at this stage in the empire’s unraveling.

*A. was receiving news of desertions and troubles, and marched at rapid speed to catch up. But he was too late… Bessus and the satrap of Hyrcania, Nabarzanes, had Darius arrested, and killed when it was clear they would not outrun Alexander.
The Death of Darius (July 330 BCE)
Bessus and Nabarzanes fled to their satrapies, and Bessus would go on to adopt the throne name of Artaxerxes V, leading a resistance to Alexander.

Alexander had Darius’ body sent back to Persepolis for a royal burial in his ancestral tomb (cf. A.’s earlier claim that Darius was a usurper).

With Bessus claiming the throne, the campaign would have to continue into Bactria. But at this stage, Alexander sent home the Greek contingents of the army with a handsome payday. One indication that the rest of his campaign would not even pretend to be about the goals of the League of Corinth…

Q) Can we place this turning point any earlier? 

The Death of Darius (July 330 BCE)
Source Criticism: Arrian’s obituary of Darius III (3.22.2-6):

This was the end of Darius, when Aristophon was archon at Athens in the month Hecatombaeon. No man showed less spirit or sense in warfare; but in other matters he committed no offence, perhaps for lack of opportunity, since the moment of his accession was also the moment of the attack on him by the Macedonians and Greeks. So even if he had had the will, he was no longer free to play the tyrant to his subjects, as his position was more dangerous than theirs. His life was one series of disasters, with no respite, after his accession. The cavalry disaster of his satraps on the Granicus happened at once, and at once Ionia and Aeolis were in the enemy’s hands, with both Phrygias, Lydia and all Caria except Halicarnassus; the loss of Halicarnassus, and then of all the coast-line as far as Cilicia soon followed. Next came his defeat at Issus, where he saw his mother with his wife and children taken prisoners; then Phoenicia and all Egypt were lost; and then he himself was among the first to flee dishonourably at Arbela, and lost the greatest army of the whole barbarian race; a fugitive from his own kingdom and a wanderer, he was at last betrayed by his own escort to the worst of fates, to be at once a king and prisoner carried off in dishonour; finally he perished by a conspiracy of his closest connections. These were the tragedies of Darius’ life. After death he had a royal burial and his children were brought up and educated by Alexander as if he were still on the throne, and Alexander married his daughter. At his death he was about fifty years old.

Issues and Problems
Pierre Briant, Darius in the Shadow of Alexander (2015): “How to speak of the last Achaemenid king by means of sources that are essentially devoted to constructing the (contradictory) images of his adversary?”

Our ancient sources show almost no interest in a structural analysis of the Achaemenid empire in its last years; can we do so if we rely primarily on those sources?

The same source problems threaten to obscure our understanding of Alexander as well: if we strip down the narrative simply to confirmed actions and policies, what kind of Alexander do we have at this point?

How was Alexander able to conquer the Persian empire? To answer that, we need to understand some key features of the structure of the Persian empire:
Not a national/ethnic identity -> but a social/ethnic elite (Persian aristocracy; some integration of local elites)
The “dynastic pact” -> Imperial administration functioned through mutual interest between aristocracy and royal dynasty
Achaemenid space: strongholds, treasuries, storehouses
Was its political strength also its military weakness?
An ideology of the king, not of the empire

Week 5A – The Return to Babylon; The Mass Wedding at Susa and the Opis Mutiny; The Death of Alexander
MS Illustration, Roman d’Alexandre (Oxford, 12th Cent.)
Babylonian Astronomical Diary, mentioning Alexander’s death (British Museum)
Events: Summer 325 – 323 BCE
*After the troops’ refusal to march any further at the Hyphasis river (Summer 326), Alexander returned to the Hydaspes and prepared the fleet to sail south to the ocean (Autumn 326).

*The passage of the army down the Indus river system actually took almost a full year; a series of excessively violent campaigns against the Malli and Oxydracae, the independent kings Sambus and Musicanus, and others. Alexander’s near death experience in the Mallian campaign.

*The whole region was subdued with a zero-tolerance policy, and by July 325 the army was reformed at Patala, while Nearchus and the fleet explored the lower Indus delta.

*In September 325, Alexander set out with the army by land, on a dangerous route through the Gedrosian desert. 

*October 325, Nearchus sets sail with the fleet, following the coast up to the Persian gulf, meeting A. in Carmania before proceeding to Susa.

*A column was dispatched earlier under Craterus (3 phalanx battalions, A.’s newly acquired elephants, and veterans deemed unfit for service), taking an easier road to Carmania.



Events: Summer 325 – 323 BCE
*The march through Gedrosia was dangerous: despite its reduced size, the army and camp followers were very large, making water supply a major concern.

*There was also fighting along the way: first against the independent Oreitae in eastern Baluchistan. A. was in a rush to secure the territory and make sure of the safety of the fleet, leaving Leonnatus behind to keep control.

*~End of October 325, Alexander takes to the road through Gedrosia. Once again inspired by mythical/historical precedents (the legendary queen Semiramis and Cyrus the Great were both believed to have lost armies here: Arrian 6.24.2-3).

*The march through Gedrosia was certainly costly: Diodorus says A. lost “many” of his soldiers, and Plutarch (66) says that he lost ¾ of his troops. This is highly unlikely based on later numbers, and indeed the travel was probably hardest on the non-fighting camp followers.

*Bosworth notes that the most vivid accounts of the sufferings on the march probably derive from Nearchus, who was cruising along with the fleet!

Q) Even if it was not a military calamity, what effect might this march have on Alexander’s followers? The military objectives were minor, so why not take a longer, safer route?
Events: Summer 325 – 323 BCE
*After the first 60 days march, A. and the army arrived in the Gedrosia capital of Pura. There he received supplies sent for from neighboring provinces, and began to receive reports of some minor rebellions, and more disturbingly, that various satraps in the central regions of the empire were acting a little too independently. 

*Winter 324: After meeting with Nearchus in Carmania, A. proceeded to Persepolis and Pasargadae.

*Presumably, with Alexander far to the east for several years, some satraps had started to assume he would never return. When he did, there was a general purge of several Persian satraps (only Atropates in Media and Phrataphernes in Parthia, along with his own father-in-law Oxyartes proved their loyalty).

*Their replacements would be Macedonians, notably Peucestas, who had risen to a prominent position, was appointed to the satrapy of Persis.

Plutarch (68): “But the increasing difficulties of his march back, his wound among the Malli, and the losses in his army, which were reported to be heavy, led men to doubt his safe return, inclined subject peoples to revolt, and bred great injustice, rapacity, and insolence in the generals and satraps whom he had appointed. In a word, restlessness and a desire for change spread everywhere.”
Events: Summer 325 – 323 BCE
*A. also executed three Macedonian generals (Cleander, Sitalces, and Heracon) who had been in Media, for abuse of their position and oppression of the population (Arrian 6.27.3-5): “in Alexander’s empire, oppression of the ruled by the rulers was not tolerated.” 

-> Arrian’s remark might be something of an exaggeration, but there does seem to be a distinct difference between Alexander’s treatment of resistance and his policy toward subject populations.

*At Pasargadae, a commonly reported anecdote of Alexander’s anger at the desecration of Cyrus the Great’s tomb (Arrian 6.29; Plutarch 69); Plutarch adds that he ordered the Persian inscription to be copied in Greek as well:

Ὦ ἄνθρωπε, ὅστις εἶ καὶ ὅθεν ἥκεις, ὅτι μὲν γὰρ ἥξεις, οἶδα, ἐγὼ Κῦρος εἰμὶ ὁ Πέρσαις κτησάμενος τὴν ἀρχήν. μὴ οὖν τῆς ὀλίγης μοι ταύτης γῆς φθονήσῃς ἣ τοὐμὸν σῶμα περικαλύπτει.

”Man, whoever you are and wherever you come from, because you will come, I know; I am Cyrus and I acquired an empire for the Persians. So do not begrudge me this little earth which covers my body”. 

*Plutarch (69) says these words reminded Alexander of the mutability and uncertainty of life.
Events: Summer 325 – 323 BCE
*Arrian (7.1) tells us “a longing seized” Alexander to sail down the Euphrates to the Persian gulf, with others reporting that he planned to conquer North Africa (Carthage), the Black sea region, or even Italy “because he was beginning to feel some anxiety about the growing power of Rome”.

*In Persis, the Indian philosopher Calanus, who had been accompanying Alexander died. Note the long digression in Arrian (7.2-3); a proto-Stoic? 

*March 324: Alexander arrives in Susa, as does Nearchus. 

Mass Marriage at Susa:
Alexander married Stateira, daughter of Darius III (sometimes, confusingly, called Barsine), and according to Aristobulus (Arrian 7.4.4), also Parysatis the daughter of Artaxerxes III.
Hephaestion to Stateira’s sister, Drypetis
Leading Macedonians (Craterus, Ptolemy, Perdiccas, Eumenes, Nearchus, Seleucus) were married to the daughters of prominent Persian satraps (only Seleucus’ marriage to Apame did not end in divorce!) along with 80 more of the companions.
The weddings were a public celebration, and held according to Persian custom.
Arrian (7.4.8) states that the 10,000 Macedonians who had already married ‘Asian’ women were registered and given wedding gifts at the occasion.

Events: Summer 325 – 323 BCE
Q) What are the symbolic implications of the weddings at Susa?
Q) What are the concrete political ramifications?

*The weddings at Susa showed Alexander’s generosity to his army: he decided to pay off all of the debts of his men, which required a registry and at first caused friction.

*Arrian relates that after some initial reluctance, “it is said that” some 20,000 talents were paid out to indebted soldiers (Diodorus 17.109.2 = 10,000, likewise Plutarch, except he states 9,870 talents were paid to the wedding guests).

*It brings up some interesting questions: How were his soldiers so in debt, and to whom? And why pay soldiers’ debts instead of a universal gift?

->Diodorus seems to conflate the timing of the weddings and gifts at Susa and the mutiny at Opis, but this occurred several months later in the summer of 324! 

Q) Diodorus is mistaken, but what’s the connection?


Events: Summer 325 – 323 BCE
*It is also at Alexander’s time in Susa that the epigoni, the 30,000 cadets from the eastern provinces who were trained in and equipped for Macedonian phalanx warfare, arrive and cause some contention with the Macedonian troops.

Arrian (7.6.2): “It is said that their arrival caused bad feeling among the Macedonians, as it seemed that Alexander was looking for every means of reducing his dependence on Macedonians. And there were other grievances. A sore point was the sight of Alexander in Median dress, and most of the Macedonians found it distasteful that the marriages had followed the Persian rite… despite the great honour of sharing it on a level with their king.”

-> Peucestas, newly favored and now satrap of Persis, also adopts Persian dress and language
-> Dilution of companion cavalry with Bactrian, Sogdian etc.
-> Male sons of Persian aristocracy drafted into elite corps


Events: Summer 325 – 323 BCE
Mutiny at Opis (Summer 324)

After sailing out to the Persian gulf and back up the Tigris river, Alexander faced the most heated discontent of his campaign at the town of Opis, near modern Baghdad.

*Our sources place several complaints at Susa (weddings, epigoni, ‘Persianizing’), but the discontent spilled into the open at Opis:

Alexander announced that he would send home any troops who were no longer fit for service (Arrian 7.8.1): “Doubtless Alexander thought that this announcement would meet a popular reception. But by now the Macedonians had formed the impression that they counted for nothing and were regarded by Alexander as quite superfluous…”

(Arrian 7.8.3): “They told Alexander that he might as well discharge the whole lot of them, and take his father on his next campaign – a sneering reference to Ammon. This infuriated Alexander.”

A. quickly had 13 ringleaders arrested, and ordered their execution. Followed by a long set-piece speech in Arrian (7.9-10; cf. Hyphasis ‘mutiny’)


Events: Summer 325 – 323 BCE
In Arrian’s account, the crowd of soldiers were stunned and didn’t know what to do. When they heard about Alexander’s promotion of Persians to army units with Macedonian titles (Companion cavalry, Silver Shields and so on), they begged forgiveness, led by Callines a high-ranking veteran (Arrian 7.11.2-7).

Hardly a “mutiny”; but note the emphasis on the agitators in the crowd and the shift in mood after they are removed -> Standard Greek/Roman elite attitudes toward collective action and crowd behavior.

The veterans were then dismissed, with extra pay, and to be led by Craterus (ostensibly to build trust); but their children by non-Macedonian women were to be left behind and raised “in the Macedonian way” (Arrian 7.12.1-2)

Q) Why would Alexander make this demand?

The vulgate tradition differs substantially: no mention of Craterus, seeming conflation of Susa/Opis; details reported differently; no long speech by Alexander…

There may, however, be a connection between Alexander’s generosity at Susa, and anticipated reaction to the discharge of troops and the shifts in army organization.
Events: Summer 325 – 323 BCE
Problems remain: 
Why would anyone be angry at the dismissal of ageing and disabled veterans? (Arrian’s minimal attempt to understand the motives of the ’mutiny’ is pretty weak conjecture)

None of the actual complaints alluded to by our various sources are actually voiced at the ‘mutiny’, but only in the reconciliation with Alexander afterwards.

The conjecture that the troops really wanted to ‘go home’ is weakened by future events: the troops dismissed with Craterus would spend 2 years in Asia Minor, and then end up fighting the Greeks with Antipater in the Lamian war.

This, along with the number of troops sent with Craterus (~10,000 at Arrian 7.12.1) strongly suggests that the discharged men were not all too old or disabled to fight.

Q) So what do you think the ‘mutiny’ (better, protest?) was about?

Q) And what was Alexander actually ordering at Opis?


From Brice, 2012 – Military Unrest in the Age of Philip and Alexander
Events: Summer 325 – 323 BCE
The “Exiles’ Decree” (4th of August, 324)
At the Olympic games, Alexander had it announced that all Greek cities had to accept the return of political exiles (except those guilty of murder).
A strong contradiction of both the laws and spirit of the league of Corinth, and autonomy of Greek city-states.
There were both many exiles at Alexander’s court lobbying for their return, and many entire communities (notably Samos, entirely exiled by the Athenians decades earlier) 
An act of an autocratic benefactor; but Diodorus (18.8.2) also notes that with the Exiles’ decree, Alexander would be installing his own partisans in many cities as a check on any revolutionary tendencies.
The decree was backed by the force of Antipater’s army; also likely aimed at breaking up Athenian and Aetolian federated power. 
The politics of the decree are complex, but the crucial point is that it shows Alexander treating the Greek cities very differently than when he had departed, no political negotiations, but royal decrees.

The Death of Hephaestion (October 324)
- While holding festivities at Ecbatana, Hephaestion became sick and died. 
Arrian (7.14) relates that there are many different accounts of how A. grieved for Hephaestion, but all agree that it was intense.
Events: Summer 325 – 323 BCE
What was Next?

Arrian 7.1: “After reaching Pasargadae and Persepolis Alexander was seized with a longing to sail down the Euphrates and Tigris to the Persian Sea, and to see the outlets of the rivers into the sea, like that of the Indus, and the sea in that region. Some have also recorded that Alexander was planning to sail round most of Arabia, Ethiopia, Libya and the Nomads beyond Mount Atlas, Gadeira [Cadiz] and into our sea and, after subduing Libya and Carthage, finally to earn the title of king of all Asia; as for the Persian and Median kings, in his view they had not ruled even a fraction of Asia, and so had no right to call themselves Great Kings. Thereafter, in some accounts, he planned to sail into the Euxine [Black] Sea to Scythia [Russia] and Lake Maeotis [Sea of Azov], in others to make for Sicily and the Iapygian promontory [Capo S. Maria di Leuca], as he was already rather disturbed that Rome’s fame was advancing to a great height.”
The Death of Alexander: June 10/11, 323 BCE
*One of the greatest problems in Alexander’s history is his death Babylon (precisely dated via Babylonian Astronomical Diary):

Certainties:
Alexander died in Babylon after a period of ~10 days of increasing illness, following a drinking party hosted by Medius.
Sources unanimous in reporting that a variety of omens preceded Alexander’s death, but not unanimous in which omens (Arrian, Plutarch, Diodorus, and Justin all report that Chaldaean seers warned Alexander not to enter Babylon based on an oracle in Spring 323).
Rumors of poisoning certainly circulated after Alexander’s death; but most of our main sources dismiss them (The most prevalent story, at Arrian 7.27.1-2, Plutarch 77, was that Antipater and his sons Cassander/Iolaus were prime suspects, which was certainly going around by 317).

*Both Arrian and Plutarch cite (for the first time) as a source the Royal Diaries (Ephemerides) as an account for Alexander’s illness and final days. 
The diaries seem trustworthy, unless they were specifically written to refute rumors of poisoning.
The cause of Alexander’s death is also hopelessly entwined with the later struggles between factions after his death (Antipater and Cassander accused later by Perdiccas, Olympias)

The Death of Alexander: June 10/11, 323 BCE
*Bosworth (1971), highlighting that rumors of poisoning close after Alexander’s death should be taken seriously, and dismissing the Ephemerides (since they aren’t used as a source elsewhere), argues that the poisoning theory is likely:

Ephemerides cited differently by Arrian and Plutarch
Ephemerides mention a temple of Serapis in Babylon, but this is a feature of Ptolemaic Egypt.
Thus the Ephemerides might be early propaganda, and successively altered in the source tradition: Likely composed by Eumenes of Cardia, before the breakdown between Antipater and Perdiccas in 322/321.
There must have been hostility between Alexander and Antipater: Olympias had been actively hostile since 330, and Craterus was being sent back to Macedonia to replace him. Hence the embassy from his son Cassander in 323.

Many scientists have attempted to examine the evidence for cause of death, with many incompatible theories put forward: none have found strong evidence of poisoning, but none have found a single convincing natural cause either. 

Q) Is this question impossible to penetrate? If not, what insights might come from the attempt? 

Last Plans and Succession
When Alexander died, his first wife Roxane was still pregnant with the future Alexander IV; his brother Philip Arrhidaeus (soon Philip III) was not capable of ruling himself.

There are two main accounts of Alexander’s final words/actions before his death. Arrian (7.26.3) states explicitly that neither Aristobulus or Ptolemy mention either:

When asked by companions who he would leave his kingdom to: “To the strongest”.
-> The consequences of this statement are made clear by the addition that A. foresaw “great funeral games” following his death (i.e. conflict; Arrian 7.26.3; Diodorus 18.1).

In some accounts (Diodorus 17.117.3; QC 10.5.4), A. hands his signet ring to Perdiccas (effectively the 2nd in command and most influential of the generals).
-> These two acts would not be contradictory; the ring would signify management of royal affairs on an interim basis, at most a regency.

Q) Why would Alexander foresee, and accept, the inevitable conflict that would follow his death? What precedents made this inevitable?



The Funeral Games Begin
Two factions emerged soon after Alexander’s death: 
Perdiccas, acting as regent over the unborn child, along with the Macedonian elite and cavalry
Meleager, on behalf of the infantry and supporting Philip Arrhidaeus

Meleager seems to have drawn on conservative elements and resistance to Alexander’s ‘Persianizing’ policies. An element of class conflict in the army?

But Meleager’s faction quickly broke down, and a reconciliation was effected with Perdiccas serving as regent over Philip and the future Alexander, who would rule as co-kings.

At the “Partition of Babylon”, satrapies were designated. Most significantly, Ptolemy was granted Egypt by request.

323/322: The Lamian War (Athens and coalition of Greek cities rebel)

In 321, power-grabs were already under way: Antipater/Craterus/Antigonus prepared for war against Perdiccas; Perdiccas took an army to Egypt against Ptolemy, but was killed in a mutiny in his camp.

Another partition in 320, at Triparadeisos: Antipater as regent over the co-rulers, and Seleucus ascends to Babylonia.

Arrian, Anabasis 3.3.3-6

After this a longing seized Alexander to pay a visit to Ammon in Libya, for one reason to consult the god, since the oracle of Ammon was said to be infallible, and to have been consulted by Perseus, when he was sent by Polydectes against the Gorgon, and by Heracles when he was on his way into Libya to find Antaeus, and into Egypt to find Busiris. Alexander sought to rival Perseus and Heracles, as he was descended from them both; and in addition he himself traced his birth in part to Ammon, just as the legends traced that of Heracles and Perseus to Zeus….
Now Ptolemy son of Lagos says that two serpents preceded the army giving voice, and Alexander told his leaders to follow them and trust the divinity; and the serpents led the way to the oracle and back again. But Aristobulus agrees with the more common and prevalent version, that two crows, flying in advance of the army, acted as guides to Alexander. That some divine help was given him I can confidently assert, because probability suggests it too; but the exact truth of the story cannot be told; that is precluded by the way in which different writers about Alexander have given different accounts.

Diodorus, Library 17.53

By the time he heard of his arrival, Darius had already assembled his forces from all directions and made everything ready for the battle. He had fashioned swords and lances much longer than his earlier types because it was thought that Alexander had had a great advantage in this respect in the battle in Cilicia. He had also constructed two hundred scythe-bearing chariots well designed to astonish and terrify the enemy. From each of these there projected out beyond the trace horses scythes three spans long, attached to the yoke, and presenting their cutting edges to the front. At the axle housings there were two more scythes pointing straight out with their cutting edges turned to the front like the others, but longer and broader. Curved blades were fitted to the ends of these. All of the force the king adorned with shining armour and with brilliant commanders. As he marched out of Babylon, he had with him eight hundred thousand infantry and no less than two hundred thousand cavalry…
Pitching camp at a village named Arbela, he drilled his troops daily and made them well disciplined by continued training and practice. He was most concerned lest some confusion should arise in the battle from the numerous peoples assembled who differed in speech.

Plutarch, Life of Alexander 38

After this, when Alexander was about to march against Darius, he happened to get involved in a rowdy drinking party with his companions. Some women were there too, who had come in a drunken revel to see their lovers. The most celebrated of these was Thaïs, an Athenian, the mistress of Ptolemy who later became the ruler of Egypt. As the drinking went on, Thaïs delivered a speech which was intended partly as a graceful compliment to Alexander and partly to amuse him…
She wanted to put a torch to the building herself in full view of Alexander, so that posterity should know that the women who followed Alexander had taken a more terrible revenge for the wrongs of Greece than all the famous commanders of earlier times by land or sea. Her speech was greeted by wild applause and the king’s companions excitedly urged him on until at last he allowed himself to be persuaded…
According to some writers, it was in this way that the palace was burned down, that is, on impulse, but there are others who maintain that it was an act of deliberate policy. However this may be, it is agreed that Alexander quickly repented and gave orders for the fire to be put out.
