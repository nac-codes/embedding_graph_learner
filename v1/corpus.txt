There’s a road but it’s pretty difficult, would’ve been. Impassable at another time

Upon his return, Alexander discovered that some of the satraps (provincial governors) he had left in charge had abused their power. He executed several of them, such as Abulites of Susiana and Oxyartes of Persis, to reassert control and discipline.

### 324 BCE: The Mass Weddings at Susa
**4** **The Mass Wedding Ceremony**:
	* In early 324 BCE, Alexander organized a mass wedding ceremony at Susa, the administrative capital of the Achaemenid Empire. The event was meant to solidify the union between Macedonian and Persian cultures.
	* Alexander married Stateira (also known as Barsine), the daughter of Darius III, and possibly another Persian noblewoman, Parysatis. His close companions and officers also married Persian noblewomen during this event.
	* The ceremony included lavish celebrations, showcasing a blend of Macedonian and Persian traditions, and aimed to integrate the two cultures.

Integrate both cultures

Many of the soldiers were indebted apparently, 
“It is said that some 20k talents were paid out to indebted soldiers”

The epigoni, 30k cadets from the easter provinces arrive, cause contention

Seemed that Alexander was looking to reduce his dependence on Macedonians.

But by now the Macedonians had formed the impression that they counted for nothing and were regarded by Alexander as quite superfluous

Army becoming more and more Persian, but the people who hold the power are Macedonians, satraps

“They told Alexander that he might as well discharge the whole lot of them, and take his father on his next campaign — a sneering reference to Amnon. This infuriated Alexander.

“Historicizing military history”

Obstacles to writing an objective military history
* Author bias
* Preconceptions
* Retrospective

Can a military history of Alexander be situated in the longue durée

Antela-Bernardez
“Some scholars have cast doubt on the degree of Alexander’s success,
contrasting his conquests and victories with the rapid dismemberment
of his empire, but what remains unquestionable is that the impact of his
conquests led to the emergence of a culture that amalgamated the
traditions of the conquered territories under the ascendancy of Greek
language and culture, and that in this amalgam were the seeds of much
of the culture of imperial Rome and indeed modern-day Europe.
Alexander’s real triumph lies, essentially, in transforming Greek culture
into a universal and ecumenical heritage for mankind”

Vs strauss
“Think of Alexander as an awful accident-in which the right man got the right tools to use against the right foe-or let him inspire you. In either case, do not
forget that after Alexander's death, the Macedonians tore up his plans for future conquest. Few will regret that history has never quite seen his like again.”

Cultural development … amalgamation 

Aristocratic royal Macedonian culture
Greek cultural education
Intense emphasis on the Homeric World?
* Feudal landowners
* Athenian democratic institutions not so similar
* Perfect synthesis with Macedon

Egyptian royal culture …. Local control

Babylonian royal culture

Persian royal culture

Alexander held games and festivals in Greek tradition accompanied by Greek cultural figures
* Against idea that he lost his greenness 

Controlled his representation in visual arts , apparently only allowing the painter Apelles and sculptor Lysippuys to represent him (at least in the Greek world)

Reading in greek tradition, homer, philosophy (Diogenes, calamus)

No doubt that Alexander’s conquests laid the groundwork for the rapid and distant spread of greek culture…deliberate policy?

Selective approach to greek history…Macedonia siding with the Persians?

The historical figure he most emulates is Cyrus the Great

After his death
Control over the body important

Cassander + Antigonus alliance

After the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BCE, his vast empire, which stretched from Greece to Egypt and into the Persian Empire, fell into a series of conflicts known as the Wars of the Diadochi (or Wars of the Successors). These wars were fought among Alexander’s generals and their heirs, who vied for control of different parts of his empire. Here's a concise history of these conflicts:

### The Partition of Babylon (323 BCE)
Immediately after Alexander's death, his generals convened to decide on the future of the empire. They agreed to the Partition of Babylon, which distributed the satrapies (provinces) among the generals, also known as the Diadochi:
- **Perdiccas** was appointed regent of the empire.
- **Antipater** remained as the regent of Macedonia and Greece.
- **Ptolemy** took Egypt.
- **Seleucus** was assigned the satrapy of Babylon.
- **Lysimachus** took Thrace.
- **Antigonus** controlled Phrygia, Lycia, and Pamphylia in Asia Minor.

### The First War of the Diadochi (322–320 BCE)
The first conflict broke out due to disagreements over the partition and the regency:
- **Perdiccas** attempted to centralize power but faced opposition.
- Ptolemy seized Alexander’s body and took it to Egypt, aiming to legitimize his rule.
- Perdiccas marched against Ptolemy but was assassinated by his own officers in 320 BCE, leading to the Partition of Triparadisus, which redistributed territories.

### The Second War of the Diadochi (319–315 BCE)
The struggle continued among the successors:
- **Antigonus** rose as a dominant force in Asia Minor.
- **Eumenes**, a loyal general of Alexander, initially supported Perdiccas but later opposed Antigonus.
- Eumenes was eventually defeated and killed by Antigonus in 316 BCE.

### The Third War of the Diadochi (314–311 BCE)
Antigonus' ambitions to reunite Alexander's empire led to a coalition against him:
- The coalition included **Cassander** (Antipater's son), **Ptolemy**, **Lysimachus**, and **Seleucus**.
- After several battles, the war ended in a stalemate with the Peace of 311 BCE, which temporarily divided the territories but did not resolve underlying tensions.

### The Fourth War of the Diadochi (308–301 BCE)
Antigonus and his son **Demetrius** continued their attempts to dominate the empire:
- They achieved significant victories but also faced strong resistance.
- The decisive Battle of Ipsus in 301 BCE saw Antigonus defeated and killed by a coalition of Lysimachus and Seleucus.

### The Fifth War of the Diadochi (281 BCE)
The power struggles persisted, notably between Lysimachus and Seleucus:
- Lysimachus was killed in the Battle of Corupedium in 281 BCE, solidifying Seleucus' control over much of Alexander's Asian territories.
- Shortly after, Seleucus was assassinated, marking the end of the Wars of the Diadochi.

### Outcome and the Hellenistic Kingdoms
By the end of these wars, Alexander’s empire had fragmented into several Hellenistic kingdoms:
- **Ptolemaic Egypt**: Ruled by the descendants of Ptolemy.
- **Seleucid Empire**: Spanning much of the former Persian Empire, ruled by the Seleucid dynasty.
- **Antigonid Macedonia**: Ruled by the descendants of Antigonus.
- **Attalid Pergamon**: A smaller kingdom that emerged in Asia Minor.

These kingdoms maintained elements of Greek culture and influence, known as the Hellenistic period, which lasted until the Roman conquests in the 1st century BCE.

“At this level, sophisticated, recently developed, approaches to power (power as 'battlefield', power-as-knowledge) are less useful than the straightforward anatomy of power-by-conquest or power-as-possession, precisely the forms which more sophisticated models find uninteresting.2 In this respect, one traditional method of studying the Seleukid empire has been to catalogue and illustrate forms, the same forms which Polybios singled out in his description: garrisons, tribute, and finance, or the hierarchy of governors that transmitted royal orders.”

Indian campaigns

India not the unified nation

India refers to the area around the Indus river but can include the large subcontinent in some contexts

Goal is conquest of “India” whatever that means

There was no central power coordinating resistance to Alexander: each local ruler (hyparch) and city had to be dealt with individually

Alexander made an example of the first city to resist (no name), killed all those who were fleeing burned city to the ground - Peucelaotis (leader Astis)

Aspasians

Ptolemy’s name comes up more and more in Arrian, risked death
Was he going up in the ranks? Probably but need to be careful

Garrison settlement control of restless areas; frontier strategy

Establishes previous borders of the Persian empire at the Indus, established client kings beyond/under a new expanded satrapy

At the partition of Babylon, held their expanded territories not as satraps but as vassal kings

The Hyphasis Mutiny occurred in 326 BC on the banks of the Hyphasis River in India. After years of campaigning, Alexander's troops, weary and homesick, refused to cross the river and continue deeper into India. They had heard of powerful kingdoms beyond the Hyphasis and were unwilling to face further dangers.
Alexander, enraged by their defiance, initially tried to persuade them to continue, but ultimately relented and agreed to turn back. This marked a turning point in his campaign, as it was the first time his troops had openly defied his orders.

Is it a mutiny?
Does he order them to march across India?
He tries to convince them, more of a negotiation

Alexander wanted to go further to fight more of the elephants great size and courage

# Worlds of Alexander II

#Class
Spring 334 32k infantry 5k cavalry

Alexander heads to the city of troy, “one of his most impressive acts of propaganda” Bosworth

Symbolic acts
* sacrificing at the top of protesilaus (reenacting homer)
  * Protesilaus was the first Greek hero to die in the Trojan War, as recounted in Homer’s "Iliad." By sacrificing at Protesilaus’ shrine, Alexander symbolically connected himself to the heroic tradition of the Greek warriors who fought at Troy. This act reinforced his image as a new Achilles, a warrior favored by the gods.
* sacrifice to Poseidon and nereids at sea (cf Xerxes into Europe)
  * Before his campaign into Asia, Alexander performed sacrifices to Poseidon, the god of the sea, and the Nereids, sea nymphs, to ensure safe passage and favor on his naval journey. This act mirrored the Persian king Xerxes' sacrifices when he crossed into Europe, symbolizing Alexander’s challenge to Persian authority and his ambition to conquer their empire.
* Landing: “spear-won land”?
  * According to tradition, when Alexander landed in Asia, he threw a spear into the shore, claiming the land as conquered by his own hands. This act symbolized his personal commitment to the conquest and established his rule over the new territories through his martial prowess. (Diodorus)
    * Rightful conquest … still a campaign of liberation? 
* sanctuary of Athena at Ilium, sacrifice to homeric heroes
  * Alexander visited the ancient city of Ilium (Troy) and made sacrifices at the sanctuary of Athena, the goddess of wisdom and warfare, and to the Homeric heroes. This act honored the legendary figures of the Trojan War and sought Athena’s favor, aligning himself with the epic tradition and invoking the protection and guidance of the gods.
* carries armor from trojan war into battle as sign of divine favor
  * Alexander carried armor believed to have been used in the Trojan War into his battles. This act was meant to show that he had the support of the gods and heroes of old, emphasizing his role as a favored and chosen leader.
* sacrifice to Priam “apotropaic”
  * Priam was the king of Troy during the Trojan War. Alexander’s sacrifice to Priam was intended as an apotropaic act, meant to avert evil and seek forgiveness or favor. This act could be seen as Alexander’s way of showing respect to the fallen king and seeking to cleanse any lingering curses associated with the ancient conflict.
  * Neoptolemus killed Priam post Iliad

All of this would have been reported back to the greek world

* **Alexander's Trust**: Despite warnings, including one from Parmenion (according to some versions), Alexander chose to trust his physician and took the medicine provided by Philip. He drank the potion in front of his friends, showing his confidence in Philip's loyalty. He recovered from his illness, proving the accusations false and reaffirming his trust in his close companions.

You had my father killed??
You seized the Persian throne illegitimately 
You tried to subvert the peace in Greece

### Historical Validity of Alexander's Claims

1. **Historical Grievances**: 
   - **Validity**: Partially valid. The Persian Empire had indeed invaded Greece during the Greco-Persian Wars (e.g., the invasions by Darius I and Xerxes I), which created a long-standing animosity. However, these events occurred long before Alexander's time, and the immediate relevance of these grievances was more about propaganda than direct impact on Alexander's campaign.

2. **Interference in Macedonian Affairs**:
   - **Validity**: Partially valid. The Persian Empire had historically interfered in Greek affairs, often supporting various city-states in conflicts against each other, including those against Macedon. However, by the time of Philip II, Persia’s influence had waned, and Philip’s rise was more a result of internal Greek dynamics.

3. **Accusation of Patricide**:
   - **Validity**: Likely invalid. There is no substantial historical evidence to support the claim that Darius had Philip II killed. Philip's assassination in 336 BCE was more likely due to internal political intrigue within Macedon rather than a Persian plot.

4. **Legitimacy of Rule**:
   - **Validity**: Dubious. Darius III ascended the throne through the usual machinations of Persian court politics, which were complex and often violent. Accusing Darius of illegitimacy was a common tactic to undermine his authority, but such claims are typical in political and military rhetoric.

5. **Undermining Greek Peace**:
   - **Validity**: Partially valid. The Persians did have a history of attempting to influence Greek affairs to their advantage, but by the time of Alexander, Macedon had already established significant control over Greece. The accusation was more about rallying Greek support against a common enemy.

6. **Claim to the Throne of Asia**:
   - **Validity**: Propagandistic. This was Alexander’s ambition rather than a historically justified claim. His assertion was a declaration of his intent to conquer and rule the Persian Empire rather than a reflection of any legitimate succession right.

### Audience of the Letter

The letter exchanged between Alexander and Darius would not have been a private communication solely between the two leaders. Such correspondence was likely intended for a broader audience for several reasons:

1. **Internal Audience (Alexander’s Camp)**:
   - **Purpose**: To bolster morale, justify the ongoing campaign, and reinforce Alexander's leadership and legitimacy among his troops and supporters.
   - **Evidence**: Public readings or dissemination among key military and political figures would have ensured that the contents were widely known and supported Alexander’s narrative.

2. **External Audience (Persian Camp and General Public)**:
   - **Purpose**: To undermine Darius' authority, cast doubt on his legitimacy, and sway neutral or opposing factions within the Persian Empire.
   - **Evidence**: Letters of this nature would be intended to spread through the Persian court and territories to weaken support for Darius and present Alexander as a liberator or rightful ruler.

The rhetorical nature of the letter, filled with accusations and declarations, suggests it was crafted not just for private communication but as a strategic tool in the broader context of psychological warfare and propaganda. The public nature of such correspondence would serve to reinforce Alexander's position both within his own ranks and in the eyes of his adversaries.

Foundation of Alexandria 

The seizing him, apparently a word relatively unique other than Arrian
Not in other historians of Alexanders
Ptolemaic phrase? 

"Alexander encamped beside a very fine city , and the leading notables of the citizens came out to see him . They were brought before the king , renewed their ties of kinship , and undertook to help him enthusiastically in every way , as being his relatives . They also brought him magnificent gifts . Alexander accepted their goodwill , declared their cities to be free , and marched on against the next tribes . He found that the Agalasseis , as they were called , were drawn up in battle formation."
"He decided to found a great city in Egypt , and gave orders to the men left behind with this mission to build the city between the marsh and the sea. He laid out the site and traced the streets skilfully and ordered that the city should be called after him Alexandria . It was conveniently situated near the harbour of Pharos , and by selecting the right angle of the streets , Alexander made the city breathe with the etesian winds so that as these blow across a great expanse of sea , they cool the air of the town , and so he provided its inhabitants with a moderate climate and good health ."
"A longing for the work therefore seized him ; he himself marked out where the city ' s marketplace was to be built , how many temples there were to be and the gods , some Greek , and Isis the Egyptian , for whom they were to be erected , and where the wall was to be built round it . With this in view he offered sacrifice , and the sacrifice proved favourable ."

Vulgate: A. Marked out the city walls with barley meal 

According to one anecdote mentioned in the search results, Alexander used barley meal to mark out the walls of Alexandria because he did not have other means available at the time:

"A story of the following sort is told, and personally I do not disbelieve it; Alexander desired to leave the builders outlines of the fortification, but had no means of marking the ground. One of the builders, however, had the happy thought of collecting the meal which the soldiers carried in vessels, and of dropping it on the ground wherever the king indicated. In this way was the circle of the surrounding wall which he proposed to make for the city marked out."

So according to this story, lacking chalk or other typical means to draw the outline of the city walls on the ground, Alexander improvised by having the soldiers use the barley meal from their rations to pour lines on the ground wherever he indicated the walls should be. This allowed him to quickly sketch out the perimeter and layout of the new city of Alexandria before construction began, even without proper surveying tools at hand. The use of barley meal was apparently just a clever improvisation in the moment.

Timing is suspect before or after A.’s visit to Siwah?
Alexandria before the oracle
Ptolemy would have had a large incentive to emphasize this part of the story 

Was the founding of Alexandria a separate unique event from he journey to Siwah?

Egypt the ultimate other? Egypt deeply embedded in Greek imagination myth mixed with Egypt
Historical interaction

Some tradition of viewing greek leaders as divine

Certainly! Here are detailed excerpts and accounts from Arrian and Plutarch regarding Alexander the Great's declaration as the son of Zeus-Ammon.

### Arrian's *Anabasis of Alexander* (Book III, Chapter 3)
Arrian provides a thorough account of Alexander's visit to the Oracle of Ammon and the significance of this event:

**Journey to Siwah and the Oracle's Declaration**:
- "Alexander, in the confidence of his descent from Zeus by the line of his ancestors, now wished to visit the oracle of Ammon to obtain more certain knowledge of his own affairs. He crossed the desert with much toil, and with rain, miraculously sent, as the account runs, by the god; and then at length arrived at the oracle."
- "When he approached the shrine, the prophet of Ammon saluted him as the son of the god. Alexander accepted the salutation, and asked whether any of his father's murderers had escaped him. The priest answered that he must speak more guardedly, for his father was not mortal. Alexander then asked whether he would become the ruler of all mankind. The god replied that he would. Alexander also enquired whether the murderers of Philip had been all punished. The priest answered that his father was sufficiently avenged."

**Significance and Interpretation**:
- "Thus fortified in his belief of his divine descent, Alexander departed from the temple with increased confidence in the success of his enterprises. He now sacrificed to Ammon as to Zeus, and consulted his priests on every important occasion. His companions, who had heard these things, were reluctant to report them explicitly, but they neither affirmed nor denied that Alexander was the son of Ammon."

### Plutarch's *Life of Alexander* (Chapter 27)
Plutarch offers a detailed narrative of Alexander’s visit to the Oracle of Ammon and the divine recognition he received:

**Visit to the Oracle and Divine Acknowledgment**:
- "Alexander came to the temple and was greeted by the prophet with the customary salutation of the god, who bade him 'Rejoice, son.' Alexander accepted the address and asked whether he had any concern to give an oracle. The priest, through whom the god spoke, said, 'No, for the god acknowledges you as his son.'"
- "Alexander asked whether any of the murderers of his father had escaped punishment. The priest replied that his father was not mortal. When Alexander asked whether all his father's murderers had been punished, the priest assured him that all those responsible for his father’s death had been brought to justice."

**Impact and Reaction**:
- "Rejoicing in what he had heard, Alexander returned to Egypt with increased enthusiasm and determination. He did not make public all the responses he received from the oracle, but he frequently referred to them in a manner that suggested he had been assured of his divine parentage."
- "This declaration greatly enhanced Alexander’s prestige among his troops and subjects. It also served to strengthen his resolve and justify his claim to rule over the vast territories he had conquered."

### Other Historical Accounts:

#### Diodorus Siculus (Library of History, Book XVII, Chapter 51-52)
Diodorus also provides a detailed account of Alexander’s encounter with the Oracle of Ammon:

**Divine Revelation and Proclamation**:
- "When Alexander was conducted by the priests into the temple and had regarded the god for a while, the one who held the position of prophet, an elderly man, came to him and said, 'Rejoice, son; take this form of address as from the god also.' Alexander replied, 'I accept, father; for the future I shall be called thy son. But tell me if thou givest me the rule of the whole earth.' The priest now entered the sacred enclosure, and as the bearers now lifted the god and were moved according to certain prescribed sounds of the voice, the prophet cried that of a certainty the god had granted him his request."
- "Alexander then asked, 'The last, O spirit, of my questions now answer; have I punished all those who were the murderers of my father or have some escaped me?' The prophet answered, 'Fear not; no mortal can conspire against the one who begat you. The murderers of Philip have all been punished.'"

**Aftermath and Impact**:
- "Upon hearing this, Alexander was greatly pleased and offered magnificent sacrifices to the god. He then returned to Egypt with a renewed sense of his divine mission. This event solidified his image as a divine figure among his followers and subjects, reinforcing his authority and the legitimacy of his rule."

These detailed excerpts from Arrian, Plutarch, and Diodorus Siculus highlight the significance of Alexander's visit to the Oracle of Ammon and the declaration of his divine parentage. This event not only bolstered his self-image and authority but also played a crucial role in the perception of his rule by his contemporaries and subjects.

Alexander personally overseeing the urban design of the city Alexandria
Was it just Alexander? Architects? 

Edit
Here is the relevant quote from Arrian related to Darius' peace offer during Alexander's siege:
From arrian_anabasisarrian_anabasis.txt:
"When Alexander reached the city , he encamped2 the first day where the wall seemed easiest to attack , and ordered siege engines to be fitted together .
1QC . 5 , 1 ff . puts arrival of letter from Darius here , offering the territory W. of Euphrates , 10,000 talents and his daughter ' s hand in marriage2 ; Al ' s reply ( QC ) ; cf . P. 29 , 7 f.2Late Oct . 333 b.c."
This excerpt from Arrian indicates that while Alexander was beginning his siege of Gaza, Curtius places the arrival of a letter from Darius at this point, offering Alexander all the territory west of the Euphrates, 10,000 talents, and his daughter's hand in marriage. However, the excerpt notes that this is according to Curtius, not necessarily Arrian himself. There is no mention here of Parmenion's advice or Alexander's reply.

**N**
What does this mean? what does it being a "unit" mean?
 According to this offer , Dareius would rule the east , Alexander the west , but the kingdom would remain a unit . The territory offered to Alexander was approximately that which later became a part of the Roman Empire.

Edit
In this context, the term "unit" is used to describe the Persian Empire under the proposed power-sharing agreement between Darius and Alexander. If Alexander were to accept Darius' offer, the empire would be divided into two parts: Darius would rule the eastern portion, while Alexander would rule the western portion.
However, despite this division of power, the Persian Empire would remain a single political entity or "unit." In other words, the empire would not be formally split into two separate kingdoms or states. Instead, it would continue to be recognized as a single empire, albeit with two rulers governing different regions.
The passage also notes that the territory offered to Alexander in this proposal roughly corresponded to the regions that later became part of the Roman Empire. This suggests that Darius was willing to cede a significant portion of the Persian Empire's western holdings to Alexander in order to reach a peaceful resolution to their conflict.

Afterwards athenian embassy came to Alexander at Tyre, requested freedom of the greek prisoners taken after the granicus, which he granted
* Agis revolt, Lacedaemonian war still ongoing

the broader context of Greek resistance to Macedonian dominance.

**Agis III of Sparta**:
Agis III was the king of Sparta who led a revolt against Macedonian rule. In 331 BCE, Agis took advantage of Alexander’s absence in Asia to start a rebellion in the Peloponnese. His revolt is often called the Lacedaemonian War or the Agis Revolt. This uprising was part of the larger Greek resistance against Macedonian hegemony.

Despite some initial successes, Agis’ revolt ultimately failed. The Macedonian regent Antipater, left in charge of Greece while Alexander was campaigning in Asia, defeated Agis in a decisive battle at Megalopolis in 331 BCE. Agis himself was killed in the battle, and Spartan resistance was crushed, solidifying Macedonian control over Greece.

Darius’ diplomacy, 
John Ma - argues that his administration at this time was quite creative and was handling the inevitable

  * Not the first satrap appointed by Alexander tho
* Atropates - Atropates later became the Satrap of Media under Alexander. His loyalty to Alexander ensured a more stable and cooperative governance in Media.
* Artabazus - Initially, he opposed Alexander but later submitted to him and served loyally. His sons, including Pharnabazus, also served Alexander, indicating the integration of Persian nobility into Alexander's administration.
* Ariarathes - Ariarathes later became a significant figure in the Hellenistic period, particularly in the region of Cappadocia (never conquered by Alexander). His lineage continued to rule Cappadocia, which became a client kingdom of Rome
* Orontes - After the fall of the Achaemenid Empire, the Orontids continued to rule Armenia as a semi-independent kingdom under Macedonian and later Roman influence.
  * Son Mithrenes…Mithradates enemy of Rome 

How the Persian aristocracy is getting integrated 

Rewarding cooperation and punishing resistance: Diodorus Siculus and Quintus Curtius Rufus offer insights into Alexander's approach: "Diodorus Siculus and Quintus Curtius Rufus also mention instances where Alexander showed leniency and favor towards Persian aristocrats who surrendered or cooperated with him. These accounts suggest that Alexander used a carrot-and-stick approach, rewarding those who supported him and punishing those who resisted."

Went down along Tigris instead of Euphrates bc Euphrate 

Based on the battle maps provided, here is a breakdown of what happened at the Battle of Gaugamela in 331 BC between Alexander the Great's Macedonian forces and the Persian army under Darius III:

Initial Dispositions (Image 1):
- The Persians under Darius were deployed in a long line, with Darius positioned in the center behind his infantry. 
- The Macedonians under Alexander were deployed with the phalanx in the center, flanked by Alexander with the Companion Cavalry on the right and Parmenion commanding the left.
- Both sides had chariots in front of their main battle lines.

Alexander's Movement and the Gap (Image 2): 
- Alexander led the Companion Cavalry in a rightward movement, opening up a gap between his cavalry and the Macedonian phalanx.
- This gap was likely a deliberate tactic by Alexander to lure the Persians into attacking.
- The Persians took the bait and charged into this gap in the Macedonian line.

Alexander's Decisive Charge:
- With the Persians now disordered from charging into the gap, Alexander wheeled around with his Companion Cavalry.
- He led a decisive charge right into Darius's position in the Persian center rear.
- This bold strike caused Darius to flee the battlefield, throwing the Persian army into disarray.

While not shown directly on these stylized maps, ancient sources report that Parmenion on the Macedonian left was hard-pressed by the Persian right, but held his ground. Alexander's charge proved decisive - once Darius fled, the Persian army disintegrated and the Macedonians achieved a stunning victory over a much larger Persian force. The Battle of Gaugamela marked the end of Achaemenid Persian power and opened the way for Alexander's conquest of the Persian Empire.

Chariots allowed chariots to ride trough Lines and rained javelins on them
Parmenion partially enveloped on left flank endured
Gap in center sent immortal units exposed center
Alexander moved companion cavalry at Darius center royal guard
Impetus of charge broke Persian line fled the battlefield
Began pursuit but then went back to rescue Parmenion

Arrain: Parmenion struggling on left flank sent messenger to A who was pursing the already fleeing darius; standard Plutarch…
Vulgate…
Plutarch - parmenion concerned about an attack on the baggage train sends messenger to A who responds with scorn and orders the attack on the right
Parmenion generally accused of having been sluggish and lacking in sprint, envious of his authority and pomp, cites Callisthenes
Diodorus: Parmenion sent to A for help but he couldn’t be reached and parmenion fought bravely to to hold the left flank

Can we trace the source of this anti Parmenion bias, particularly negative shift
Callisthenes? 

When did Darius flee the battle?
Arrian - darius was the first to turn and run
Astronomical Diary: (see above) the king, his troops deserted him to their cities.

Whether he was quick or late to flee, Darius fled the battle along with Nessus and gathered men on his round to Ecbatan in media, knowing Alexander would take the road to Babylon and Susa
Mazaeus fled for Babylon, waits of Alexander’s arrival

Mazaeus may have plundered the Macedonian camp instead of engaging on the left flank

Post Gaugamela; critical juncture
How did the victory at Gaugamela impact the political and military situation

Darius was still alive and could ad would prepare for another battle, nothing left to offer in diplomacy, but could still recruit from eh upper satrapies w/ Bessus

Major repetitional damage to Darius - King of the World in Babylonian document while Darius was still alive

Susa and Babylon (massive treasures ) were won along with the battle
Biggest heist in history, more money in treasuries than was circulating in Macedonian world
Haul of cash that would change world history
* This influx of wealth, estimated to be around 180,000 talents of silver and 8,000 talents of gold (equivalent to billions of dollars today), greatly increased the money supply in the Hellenistic world.
* Increased Monetization: The distribution of Persian wealth throughout the Hellenistic world accelerated the shift from a largely barter-based economy to a more monetized one, with coinage becoming more widely used in daily transactions.
* Shift in Economic Power: The transfer of wealth from Persia to Macedonia and the Greek world marked a significant shift in economic power in the ancient world.

The Death of Darius

150k talents
Talent = 6000 drachmas 
= 900 mil drachmae
1/2 drachma a day is wage 
1.8 billion annual subs

Let's convert the Attic talent to pounds, troy ounces, and then to dollars using the given figures.

1. Converting Attic talent to pounds:
   * 1 Attic talent = approximately 57 lbs (using the lower estimate of 25.8 kg)

2. Converting pounds to troy ounces:
   * 1 pound = 14.583 troy ounces
   * 57 lbs × 14.583 troy ounces/lb = 831.231 troy ounces

3. Converting troy ounces to dollars:
   * 1 troy ounce = $24.95
   * 831.231 troy ounces × $24.95/troy ounce = **$20,739.21**

Alternatively, we can convert directly from kilograms to dollars:
* 1 kilogram = $802.14
* 25.8 kg × $802.14/kg = **$20,695.21**

Therefore, one Attic talent of silver would be worth approximately **$20,700** to **$20,750** based on the current silver prices and the estimated weight of an Attic talent.
… 3,104,281,500

By wages it’s a lot more
To convert the Attic talent to current US wages, we'll use the following information:
* 1 talent = 6,000 drachmas
* Average wage in ancient Greece was 1/2 drachma per day
* Average hourly earnings in the US as of March 2024 is $11.11

First, let's calculate the annual wage in ancient Greece:
* 1/2 drachma per day × 365 days = 182.5 drachmas per year

Now, let's calculate the equivalent annual wage in the US based on the hourly earnings:
* $11.11 per hour × 40 hours per week × 52 weeks = $23,108.80 per year

To find the equivalent of 1 talent in US wages, we set up the following proportion:
* 182.5 drachmas : 1 talent = $23,108.80 : x

Solving for x:
* x = (1 talent × $23,108.80) ÷ 182.5 drachmas
* x = 6,000 drachmas × $23,108.80 ÷ 182.5 drachmas
* x = $759,960.00

Therefore, 1 Attic talent is equivalent to approximately $759,960.00 in current US wages.

For 150,000 talents:
* 150,000 talents × $759,960.00 per talent = $113,994,000,000.00

This means that 150,000 Attic talents would be equivalent to about $114 billion in current US wages.

July 330 BCE

After the battle, Darius fled to the city of Ecbatana (modern-day Hamadan, Iran) and then to Bactria (modern-day Afghanistan and parts of Central Asia). During this retreat, Darius was betrayed by one of his satraps, Bessus, who was also his relative. Bessus, along with other conspirators, arrested Darius and held him captive.
As Alexander pursued them, the conspirators realized that keeping Darius alive would be a hindrance to their escape. Therefore, they stabbed Darius and left him to die. According to some accounts, Alexander found Darius just before he succumbed to his wounds. Darius allegedly asked for water and requested that Alexander treat his family well and punish his traitorous satraps.
Alexander ordered a proper burial for Darius in the royal tombs at Persepolis, the ceremonial capital of the Persian Empire. By conquering Persia and defeating Darius, Alexander became the ruler of the vast Achaemenid Empire, marking a significant turning point in ancient history.

Ancient sources do not analyze the Achaemenid empire structurally, so how can we if we are relying on those sources

The conspiracy of (against?) PHilotas

Tension between Alexander and unknown percentage of his army
* Greek forces sent home with pay (Macedonians want to go home too
* Contingent rep by Parmenion wanted an easter frontier at the Euphrates
* Plutarch 47 says tension mentioned by Alexander in a letter to antimatter
  * Alexander began to adapt more and more of his habits to Persian custom (holding court) creating more tension between those who approved and traditionalists

Parmenion was away from he army at Media, suspicions come to a head

Based on the provided texts, there are several instances that highlight the growing tension between Alexander and some factions within his army, particularly after Darius III's death in 330 BC as Alexander pushed further east. Here are some key points, with relevant quotes:

1. Alexander dismissed the Greek allies, but the Macedonians also wished to return home:

"Alexander (a) dismissed all the Greek allies, except those who would take service as mercenaries, i.e. the survivors of 7,000 foot and 2,750 horse, mainly Thessalian; (b) detached up to 6,000 Macedonians, apparently foot, with a few horse and light troops under Harpalus to guard the treasures; the 6,000 seem to have rejoined him later..." (Arrian, Anabasis)

This suggests growing discontent among the Macedonian troops who also wished to return home like the dismissed Greek allies.

2. Parmenion advised an eastern frontier at the Euphrates river, showing disagreement with Alexander's eastward ambitions:

"Parmenio in command of the mercenaries, Thracians and all cavalry except the Companions. This last statement has every appearance of a misunderstanding; Parmenion was surely not left behind, since he appears with Al. at Persepolis and argues for an eastern frontier on the Euphrates." (Arrian, Anabasis) 


Philotas execution, public trial in front of army
Philotas execution was a dangerous move, commander of companion cavalry, father most respected of Philip’s generation

A. Sent for Parmenion to be assassinated in Media
Arrian says either
1) Paremnton knew of his son’s plot
2) He couldn’t be allowed to live (retribution likely)

Broader purge of people close to Philotas? Ptolemy benefited from whole affair, one of the somatophylakes (bodyguards) was also arrested and ptolemy took his place

A subsequent reorganization of the command structure: *companion cavalry (hetairoi)* split between Hephaestion and Cleitus

Shifts pre Bactria
* Justification for war via League of Corinth outdated
* Desire to rule *as* Great King
* Tensions in the ranks | willingness to put down

Incentives to keep going for the army?
* Cash/Land 
  * many soldiers who keep going will become colonists
* fame and glory

Badian v Tarn
* Tarn romanticized, bringing about the brotherhood of all mankind

E. Badian's article "The Death of Parmenion" examines a pivotal and controversial event in the career of Alexander the Great, highlighting the political intrigue and ruthless strategies employed during his reign. Badian critiques the perspective that has often romanticized Alexander, suggesting instead that his actions, including the elimination of Parmenio, should be viewed through a more critical lens of political necessity and calculation.

Badian argues that the execution of Parmenio and his son Philotas were not isolated incidents but part of a broader strategy by Alexander to consolidate power and eliminate threats to his authority. He discusses the tradition of Alexander's reign that involved a pattern of eliminating potential rivals, including the use of political assassination as a tool to secure his rule.

The paper delves into the specifics of the charges against Philotas, showing that they were likely fabricated to justify his execution and, subsequently, that of his father Parmenio. This event marked a significant turning point in Alexander’s reign, indicating a shift toward more autocratic methods. Badian emphasizes that Alexander’s actions were meticulously planned and executed, reflecting his strategic acumen not only in military campaigns but also in political maneuvers.

Overall, Badian's argument demystifies some of the heroic narratives surrounding Alexander the Great, presenting him as a more complex and, at times, ruthless leader. The article calls for a reevaluation of Alexander's legacy, suggesting that his political tactics were as integral to his success as his military conquests.

Philotas potentially knew of a conspiracy before hand but failed to report it
### Fabrication of Charges
The narrative of the conspiracy begins with an alleged plot involving Philotas, where he was accused of failing to report a conspiracy against Alexander's life. The primary evidence came from an obscure figure named Dimnus, who supposedly conspired against Alexander. This accusation reached Philotas through a convoluted series of reports: first, Dimnus revealed the plan to his lover, who then told his brother, who eventually reported it to Philotas. Philotas' failure to report this plot to Alexander was presented as a sign of his complicity.

Confession under torture valid?

"Alexander had declared himself the lawful successor to the
Achaemenids; but since he failed to capture Darius alive, he now
had to assert his claim against the pretender Bessus, who called himself Artaxerxes (Arr. 3.25.3). The war was bound to be
difficult, and to the Macedonians it would seem unnecessary.
The men wanted to go home, especially when they saw the
Greek allies dismissed (Curt. 6.2.15 f.); and both they and the
nobles disliked the Persici apparatus that were the symbol of
Alexander's new status and the corollary of his intention to make
his rule over Iran permanent (see, e.g., Curt. 6.6)

The Challenge of Bessus

* Alexander had no intention of letting Bessus claim kingship (Bessus was related somehow to Darius, satrap of Bactria)

* Verbal alteraction, grabs weapon killed Cleitus . In the aftermath sources report that A wanted to kill himself but was restrained, grieved
* Killing of cleitus not as politically significant

Certainly! Here are detailed excerpts from Plutarch's account which vividly describe the incident of Alexander killing Cleitus the Black:

1. **The Escalation of the Argument:**
   Plutarch describes the intense argument that erupted between Alexander and Cleitus:
   > "Then Cleitus, who was already drunk and naturally of a harsh temper and wilful, was more than ever vexed, and insisted that it was not well done, when among Barbarians and enemies, to insult Macedonians who were far better men than those who laughed at them, even though they had met with misfortune" (Plutarch).

2. **Alexander's Response and the Act of Killing:**
   The argument escalated to the point where Alexander, in a fit of rage, killed Cleitus:
   > "Thoroughly incensed, then, Alexander said: 'Base fellow, dost thou think to speak thus of me at all times, and to raise faction among Macedonians, with impunity?'... Then Alexander, no longer able to restrain his anger, threw one of the apples that lay on the table at Cleitus and hit him, and began looking about for his sword. But one of his body-guards, Aristophanes, conveyed it away before he could lay hands on it, and the rest surrounded him and begged him to desist, whereupon he sprang to his feet and called out in Macedonian speech a summons to his corps of guards" (Plutarch).

3. **Aftermath and Alexander's Remorse:**
   After Cleitus' death, Alexander was immediately filled with regret:
   > "This man, then, was afterwards held in high esteem on the ground that it was due to him more than to any one else that the camp was not thrown into commotion. But Cleitus would not give in, and with much ado his friends pushed him out of the banquet-hall. He tried to come in again, however, by another door, very boldly and contemptuously reciting these iambics from the 'Andromache' of Euripides" (Plutarch).

These excerpts from Plutarch's "Lives" capture the dramatic and tragic sequence of events during the banquet, offering a glimpse into the tensions that marked Alexander's rule and the personal flaws that sometimes led to grievous outcomes. The full text, which provides more context and details, can be accessed in translations of Plutarch's works available in public libraries or online databases of classical texts.

Samarkand
Most costly fighting for Alexander up to this point 

New policies, much larger army than any previous garrisons left behind in Bactria with its new satrap Amyntas (10k infantry, 4.5k cavalry)
* Colonization begins to play crucial role in pacifying conquered territory (not just installing a governor)
* 30k bactrian youths conscripted to be trained in Macedonian phalanx warfare (number of Macedonian phalanx that has been with Alexander) - Epigoni (lit. Offspring, giving birth to new army)
* Coupled with enslaving and population movement

Take a lot of Bactrian cavalry with him

Significant personal shifts
* A. Married a girl from the Bactrian nobility, Roxane, in part political, Alexander’s first wife 
* A. began to experiment with proskynesis: completely secular act of prostration to a superior esp Great king in Persia. In greek society it was an act reserved for gods
* The protest against this practice is centered on Callisthenes, voicing widely held resentment and soon after was arrested and executed 

Alexander the Great's introduction of proskynesis—a Persian practice of bowing or prostrating oneself before a superior—as a court custom is a notable instance of the cultural integration and political strategies he employed during his reign. This practice, deeply ingrained in Persian royal culture, symbolized the submission of subjects to the divine right and authority of their king. In Persia, proskynesis was not merely a sign of respect; it was a required display of subordination and acknowledgment of the king’s superiority.

In the context of Alexander’s empire, which spanned across diverse cultures including those of Greece and Persia, the adoption of proskynesis was multifaceted:

1. **Political Strategy**: By adopting Persian customs such as proskynesis, Alexander aimed to integrate and unify his diverse empire. It was a way to bridge the cultural divides between his Greek and Macedonian soldiers and the newly conquered Persian territories. This act was intended to legitimize his rule over the Persian subjects and to position himself within the traditional framework of Persian kingship, where the king was seen not just as a ruler but almost as a divine figure.

2. **Cultural Resistance**: The introduction of proskynesis, however, was met with significant resistance from the Greeks and Macedonians, for whom such acts of submission were reserved only for the gods. In Greek cultural and religious practice, prostrating oneself before another human was seen as an act of impiety or heresy. This resistance highlights the cultural differences Alexander had to navigate. Greek society valued political equality and freedom, especially in democratic city-states like Athens, where the idea of prostrating before any human, much less their military leader, was unthinkable.

3. **Internal Conflict**: The implementation of proskynesis became a source of tension within Alexander’s own ranks, leading to dissent and dissatisfaction among his troops. This tension was emblematic of a larger struggle within Alexander's empire between the adoption of foreign customs to manage a vast, multicultural empire and the retention of the Hellenic ideals and practices that were foundational to his Macedonian and Greek troops' identity.

4. **Divine Kingship Aspirations**: Alexander’s adoption of proskynesis also aligned with his efforts to portray himself as a divine or semi-divine figure—a status that would help solidify his authority and control over the Persian regions of his empire. By encouraging a ritual that equated him with the divine right of Persian kings, Alexander was not just adopting a foreign custom but transforming his role and perception among his subjects.

The controversy over proskynesis is a key example of the broader challenges Alexander faced in integrating a vast empire comprising various cultures. It also illustrates how Alexander’s policies often sought to meld these diverse traditions into a single imperial culture, even at the risk of alienating his original power base. This balancing act between integration and alienation was a recurring theme in his rule, reflecting both his ambitions and the practical difficulties of governing a vast and culturally diverse empire.

"But in Persia it was a mark of respect paid to superiors in rank, and therefore by all to the king. Greeks who forgot or did not know that in Persia all superiors received it believed that it betokened that the Persians worshipped the king as a god."

**Arrian's** ***Anabasis*** **(Abridged Version)**:
* "Herodotus suggests that the inferior fell on his knees, and prostration always accompanied proskynesis to the king; it was certainly expected of Greek ambassadors. But in Persian eyes they were doubtless very lowly beings; the Persepolis reliefs show that Persian dignitaries did no more than make a half-bow in obeisance to the king. In Chares’ story there is no place for prostration at Alexander’s banquet. Thus the Persian ceremony was, at least when performed by men of rank, no different in principle from the Greek, except that it was rendered to men."
* This passage explains the typical Persian interpretation of proskynesis and contrasts it with Greek customs, highlighting the cultural misunderstanding that proskynesis was akin to worship, rather than a mark of respect among equals or superiors.

⠀**Discussion on Macedonian Resistance**:
* "Greeks boasted that they ‘did obeisance to no man as a master but only to the gods’ (Xenophon, Anabasis iii 2, 13, cf. iv 1, 35). To Aristotle it was an honour that only barbarians paid to men. It is plausible to suppose that Al. sought to introduce the practice among all his courtiers, only in order to create a greater measure of equality between Persian and western notables and thus to conciliate the Persians. But that was not a motive with which the Macedonians would have sympathized. Their aversion to a ceremony they thought demeaning probably led Alexander to abandon this attempt at assimilation—with more prudence than he had made it."
* This extensive quote explains the deep-rooted cultural beliefs among Greeks and Macedonians against proskynesis, viewing it as a barbarian practice unsuitable for Greeks, who only performed such gestures towards the gods.

⠀**The Incident with Callisthenes**:
* "When, however, a silence fell after these words, the senior Persians arose and did obeisance one by one. Leonnatus, one of the Companions, thinking that one of the Persians made his obeisance ungracefully, mocked his posture as abject; Alexander was angry with him at the time, though reconciled later. The following story has also been recorded. Alexander sent round a loving cup of gold, first to those with whom he had made an agreement about obeisance; the first who drank from it rose, did obeisance, and received a kiss from Alexander, and this went round all in turn. But when the pledge came to Callisthenes, he rose, drank from the cup, went up to Alexander and made to kiss him without having done obeisance. At the moment Alexander was talking to Hephaestion, and therefore was not attending to see if the obeisance was performed by Callisthenes."
* This detailed narrative shows the pivotal moment where Callisthenes refused to perform proskynesis, marking a significant cultural and personal standoff that highlighted the broader resistance among Alexander’s Greek and Macedonian followers against adopting Persian customs.

Conspiracy of the Pages

Post Callisthenes another conspiracy emerges

One Hermolaus identified as ringleader, prev. Publicly humiliated  after a violation of protocol on a board hunt with A. And gathered several people in a plot to kill A. In his sleep

Didn’t go through with the old plan, plot was exposed the next day, In Arrian’s account it was Ptolemy who got word of the plot

Those name were arrested and tortured, confessed
Gave up the name of Callisthenes who had incited them (can’t prove)
Plutarch takes the implication of Callisthenes quite personally and says it’s slander

Every source has a different version of what happened to Callisthenes … either he was part of the plot or the plot represented a convenient moment to be rid of him as he had become too publicly critical of Alexander

The "Conspiracy of the Pages" is a pivotal event in the study of Alexander the Great, illustrating the complex political dynamics and personal relationships within his court. The conspiracy involved the young page Hermolaus and several associates who plotted to kill Alexander in retaliation for a personal humiliation during a hunting incident. Here’s how different sources describe the event and the aftermath, focusing on the role of the philosopher Callisthenes:

### Arrian's Account
Arrian provides a detailed narrative of the conspiracy, emphasizing the motivations and the personal grievances of Hermolaus. He describes how Hermolaus, after being publicly humiliated by Alexander, conspired with other pages to kill him. The plot was uncovered due to the betrayal of one of the conspirators, leading to severe repercussions:

```plaintext
"Under torture, the conspirators implicated Callisthenes... Arrian agrees with Ptolemy’s account, noting that Callisthenes was racked and hanged. The details of Hermolaus’ speech to justify his actions and Alexander's response are recorded, indicating the gravity with which Alexander viewed the breach of loyalty." (Arrian, Anabasis)
```

### Plutarch’s Perspective
Plutarch offers a more sympathetic view towards Callisthenes, suggesting that the allegations against him were part of a slander campaign due to his opposition to proskynesis (the practice of bowing to the king) and his influence over the young pages. Plutarch is critical of Alexander’s actions, suggesting they were overly harsh and possibly unjustified:

```plaintext
"Plutarch asserts that Callisthenes was unfairly implicated in the conspiracy. He challenges the legitimacy of the torture and the confessions obtained, portraying Callisthenes more as a victim of political intrigue than a co-conspirator." (Plutarch, Lives)
```

### Interpretative Analysis
These accounts reflect different historiographical approaches to Alexander's reign. Arrian, often seen as a primary source due to his reliance on eyewitness accounts, presents a detailed and somewhat procedural description of the events. Plutarch, writing with a moral and philosophical lens, focuses on the injustice and potential misuse of power by Alexander. Diodorus provides a broader historical context, emphasizing the atmosphere of fear and suspicion.

Each source offers a unique lens on the events, highlighting the complexities of historical interpretation and the challenges in understanding the true motives and actions of historical figures like Alexander the Great. These narratives not only recount the events but also explore themes of loyalty, power, and the human condition within the context of Alexander’s vast empire.

*Alexander and the necessities of rule:* was there a way to secure his rule over an empire that placed so much emphasis on the ruler (without Turing into a King of Kings himself), and at the same keep his army on board?

*New problems, new solutions:* settlements colonization extra imperial diplomacy, management of border regions, new fighting tactics all adopted as necessities in a deeply changed environment 

*Resentment, Dissent, Conspiracy:* was there any solution to avoid alienating his army? Are these isolated episodes or can we connect everything from Philotas, Parmenion, Callisthenes?

Philip II of Macedon implemented several key reforms, particularly military reforms, that played a crucial role in establishing and maintaining his power. Here’s a detailed look at his reforms and their socioeconomic impacts:

### Military Reforms

1. **The Macedonian Phalanx**
   - Philip restructured the traditional phalanx formation, making it more effective. He equipped his infantry with the sarissa, a long spear measuring 18-22 feet, which gave them a significant reach advantage. The phalanx was highly disciplined and required rigorous training, which Philip instituted.

2. **Cavalry Reforms**
   - Philip reformed the cavalry, traditionally composed of the Macedonian nobility. He created the Companion Cavalry (Hetairoi), an elite unit loyal directly to the king. The nobility, now serving as Companion Cavalry, were closely tied to Philip through both military service and personal loyalty.
     - Previously, the nobility provided their own horses and equipment and were responsible for maintaining their readiness for war. This feudal system of levying nobles for military service was common throughout Greece and other regions during this period.

3. **Use of Siege Warfare**
   - Philip introduced advanced siege techniques and artillery, enabling him to conquer fortified cities that were previously considered impregnable. This expanded his control over various Greek states and regions.

4. **Integration of Nobility**
   - To ensure the loyalty of the nobility, Philip took their sons as hostages and educated them at his court. These young nobles, known as the Royal Pages (Pezhetairoi), were trained and groomed to become officers and generals in his army. This practice not only secured their loyalty but also created a professional officer class.

### Socioeconomic Reforms

1. **Land Redistribution**
   - Philip undertook land reforms to weaken the power of the traditional aristocracy. He confiscated lands from nobles who opposed him and redistributed them to his loyal followers, veterans, and the newly settled populations in conquered territories. This policy reduced the economic power of the old nobility and created a new class of landowners loyal to him.

2. **Economic Centralization**
   - Philip centralized the economic administration of Macedonia, increasing the kingdom's wealth through improved management of resources, including mines and agricultural lands. This centralization allowed him to fund his military campaigns and maintain a standing army.

3. **Creation of New Settlements**
   - Philip founded numerous cities and settlements, often populated by veterans and loyal subjects. These new settlements helped secure his territorial gains and spread Macedonian culture and influence.

### Impact on Nobility and Society


1. **Reduction of Noble Power**
   - By integrating the nobility into his military and administrative framework, Philip reduced their independent power. The reliance of the nobility on royal favor for land and positions weakened their ability to oppose him.

2. **Professionalization of the Army**
   - The military reforms led to the creation of a professional and highly disciplined army, which was crucial for Philip’s conquests and control over Greece. The professional army was loyal to Philip, not to individual nobles.

3. **Social Mobility**
   - The land reforms and the creation of new settlements provided opportunities for social mobility. Commoners and soldiers could gain land and status, further diminishing the traditional power of the aristocracy.

4. **Economic Growth**
   - Centralized economic control and exploitation of resources, such as the gold mines of Pangaion, led to increased wealth for Macedonia. This economic growth funded further military campaigns and bolstered Philip’s political power.

Phillip was a political hostage in Thebes

The rise of Philip II of Macedon (382-336 BCE) marked a significant turning point in ancient Greek history. Born into the royal family of Macedon, Philip spent his early years as a hostage in Thebes, where he gained valuable insights into Greek politics and military tactics.

After returning to Macedon and becoming king in 359 BCE, Philip set out to strengthen his kingdom and expand his influence. He began by reorganizing the Macedonian army, introducing the sarissa, a long spear that became a key weapon of the Macedonian phalanx. He also implemented rigorous training and discipline, creating a highly effective military force.

Philip's military prowess was put to the test as he embarked on a series of campaigns to subdue neighboring tribes and expand Macedonian territory. He conquered the region of Paeonia and defeated the Illyrians, securing Macedon's borders and gaining access to valuable resources.

In 356 BCE, Philip captured the city of Crenides, which he renamed Philippi. The gold mines near Philippi provided Philip with a significant source of wealth, which he used to finance his military campaigns and diplomatic efforts.

Philip's ambitions soon turned towards the Greek city-states. He began by intervening in the Third Sacred War (356-346 BCE) on the side of the Thessalian League against Phocis. Through a combination of military victories and diplomatic maneuvering, Philip gained control over Thessaly and was appointed as the leader of the Thessalian League.

Philip's influence in Greece continued to grow as he sought to establish Macedonian hegemony. He used a combination of military force, threats, and bribery to gain the compliance of various city-states. In 338 BCE, Philip defeated a combined force of Athens and Thebes at the Battle of Chaeronea, effectively bringing all of Greece under Macedonian control.

With Greece under his hegemony, Philip began planning a campaign against the Persian Empire. However, he was assassinated in 336 BCE, and the task of leading the campaign fell to his son, Alexander the Great.

Philip's rise to power transformed Macedon from a peripheral kingdom into a dominant force in the Greek world. His military reforms, strategic conquests, and diplomatic skills laid the foundation for the Macedonian Empire and paved the way for his son's legendary conquests. Philip's legacy, though controversial due to his methods of expansion, remains a significant chapter in the history of ancient Greece.

Phillip remarked that if Thrace had ever united under one king then they would rule the greek world, there actually had been a king Cotys but he died and there were disagreements over his succession

Early in Philip II's reign, Macedon faced significant threats from its neighbors, particularly the Illyrians, Paeonians, and Thracians.
1 Illyrians: The Illyrians, located to the west of Macedon, posed a constant threat. They were known for their raids and incursions into Macedonian territory. In 359 BCE, shortly after Philip came to power, the Illyrians defeated the Macedonian army and killed the previous king, Perdiccas III, along with 4,000 Macedonian soldiers. This defeat highlighted the vulnerability of Macedon and the need for military reforms.
2 Paeonians: The Paeonians, situated to the north of Macedon, also presented a challenge to Philip's rule. Like the Illyrians, they often conducted raids into Macedonian territory, taking advantage of Macedon's weakened state.
3 Thracians: To the east of Macedon lay the Thracian tribes, which were known for their military prowess and independence. The Thracians had a history of conflicts with Macedon and posed a potential threat to Philip's kingdom.

⠀In addition to these external threats, Philip also faced internal challenges, including rival claimants to the Macedonian throne and the need to consolidate his authority within the kingdom.
Recognizing the precarious position of Macedon, Philip set out to address these threats through a combination of military campaigns, diplomatic maneuvering, and strategic alliances. He reorganized the Macedonian army, making it a more effective fighting force, and embarked on campaigns to subdue the Illyrians and Paeonians. Philip also sought to establish friendly relations with some of the Thracian tribes to secure his eastern border.
By effectively dealing with these neighboring threats, Philip was able to strengthen Macedon's position and lay the groundwork for his subsequent expansion into Greece and beyond.

Philip II employed a combination of military campaigns, diplomacy, and strategic alliances to deal with the threats posed by the Illyrians, Paeonians, and Thracians. Let's break down his approach to each of these neighbors:

1. Illyrians:
   - Military Campaigns: After the devastating defeat of the Macedonian army by the Illyrians in 359 BCE, Philip recognized the need to strengthen his military. He reformed the Macedonian army, introducing the sarissa and the Macedonian phalanx formation. With his reformed army, Philip launched a series of campaigns against the Illyrians. In 358 BCE, he decisively defeated the Illyrians led by King Bardylis, securing Macedon's western border.
   - Diplomacy: Philip also employed diplomacy to deal with the Illyrians. He negotiated a treaty with Grabos, an Illyrian king, which helped to stabilize the border region and prevent further incursions.
   - Buffer Zone: To further secure Macedon's western frontier, Philip established a buffer zone by conquering and annexing the region of Lynkestis, which lay between Macedon and Illyria.

2. Paeonians:
   - Military Campaigns: Philip conducted military campaigns against the Paeonians to subdue their raids and bring them under Macedonian control. In 358 BCE, he launched an expedition against the Paeonian king Agis, defeating him and incorporating Paeonia into the Macedonian kingdom.
   - Annexation: By annexing Paeonia, Philip not only eliminated the threat posed by the Paeonians but also gained access to their resources and manpower, which he could use to further strengthen his army.

3. Thracians:
   - Diplomacy: Philip initially sought to establish friendly relations with some of the Thracian tribes. He married Olympias, a princess from the Molossian royal house in Epirus, which had ties to the Thracians. This diplomatic marriage helped to secure his eastern border.
   - Military Campaigns: However, not all Thracian tribes were amenable to Philip's diplomatic efforts. In 352 BCE, Philip campaigned against the Thracian king Cersobleptes and conquered the region of Thessaly, which bordered Thrace. This campaign helped to extend Macedonian influence and create a buffer zone against potential Thracian incursions.
   - Conquest and Annexation: In 346 BCE, Philip conquered the Thracian city of Crenides, which he renamed Philippi. The gold mines near Philippi provided Philip with a valuable source of wealth to finance his military campaigns and further expand his influence.

In addition to these specific actions, Philip also employed a strategy of divide and rule, taking advantage of the divisions and rivalries among the various tribes and city-states. He would often support one faction against another, gradually extending Macedonian influence and control.

By employing a combination of military force, diplomacy, and strategic alliances, Philip was able to effectively deal with the threats posed by the Illyrians, Paeonians, and Thracians. These actions not only secured Macedon's borders but also laid the foundation for Philip's subsequent expansion into Greece and beyond.

QUESTIONS
* what were the militaries of each of these (illyrians, Paeonians etc) like were they mostly cavalry ? why was the sarissa an effective developement against these sorts of troops?
  * Response - phalanx sarrissa
  * so why would a slow phalanx be effective against light infantry in illyrium using hit and run tactics in mountanous terrain? wouldn't it be not effective?
You raise a valid point. The Macedonian phalanx, with its slow-moving formation and long sarissas, would indeed face challenges when fighting against light infantry using hit-and-run tactics in mountainous terrain.

The Illyrians, with their light infantry and knowledge of the local terrain, could use guerrilla-style warfare to their advantage. They could strike quickly, inflict damage, and then retreat before the Macedonian phalanx could effectively respond. In mountainous terrain, the phalanx would struggle to maintain its tight formation and would be vulnerable to ambushes and flanking attacks.

However, it's important to note that Philip II's military success against the Illyrians was not solely due to the sarissa or the phalanx. Philip employed a combined arms approach that included various types of troops and tactics:

1. Cavalry: Philip II placed great emphasis on developing a strong cavalry force. The Macedonian cavalry, known as the Companions, were well-trained and equipped. They could be used to counter the Illyrian cavalry, pursue the light infantry, and protect the flanks of the phalanx.

2. Light Infantry: In addition to the phalanx, the Macedonian army also included light infantry units, such as the Hypaspists and the Agrianians. These troops were more mobile and could be used to engage the Illyrian light infantry on their own terms, countering their hit-and-run tactics.

3. Tactical Flexibility: Philip II was known for his tactical flexibility and ability to adapt to different battlefield situations. He likely employed a variety of tactics against the Illyrians, depending on the terrain and the specific circumstances of each engagement.

4. Diplomacy and Politics: Philip II's success against the Illyrians was not solely due to military victories. He also employed diplomatic means, such as forming alliances with friendly Illyrian tribes and exploiting the divisions among the Illyrians to weaken their resistance.

While the Macedonian phalanx and the sarissa were indeed effective innovations, they were not the only factors in Philip II's success against the Illyrians. It was the combination of military reforms, tactical flexibility, and diplomatic maneuvering that allowed Philip to overcome the challenges posed by the Illyrian light infantry in mountainous terrain.

Certainly! Here's a detailed historical timeline of Philip II's involvement with the Greek city-states and his establishment of control over them:

Hegemon
Local democratic politics 
Lost power to do foreign policy
Guaranteed security

Justification:
1 Protecting Macedonian interests: Philip II justified his interventions in Greek city-state affairs as necessary actions to protect Macedonian interests. For example, his involvement in the conflict between Amphipolis and Pydna was portrayed as an effort to secure Macedon's northern borders and prevent potential threats from these city-states.
2 Maintaining stability: Philip II often presented himself as a mediator and peacekeeper in Greek conflicts. By intervening in the disputes between city-states, he could argue that he was working to maintain stability and order in the region, which aligned with Macedonian interests.
3 Supporting allies: In some cases, Philip II justified his actions as supporting his allies in Greece. For example, his intervention in the Third Sacred War on the side of the Amphictyonic League against Phocis was presented as fulfilling his obligations to his allies and upholding the sacred traditions of the Greek world.

⠀Strategic angles:
1 Expanding influence: Philip II sought to expand Macedonian influence in the Greek world. By intervening in city-state politics and conflicts, he could gradually increase Macedon's power and control over the region.
2 Securing resources: Philip II's interventions often targeted city-states with strategic resources, such as the gold and silver mines near Amphipolis and Philippi. By gaining control over these resources, he could strengthen Macedon's economy and fund his military campaigns.
3 Weakening rivals: Philip II's actions also aimed to weaken potential rivals and challengers to Macedonian power. By intervening in conflicts and supporting certain factions, he could disrupt the balance of power among the Greek city-states and prevent the emergence of a strong, united opposition to Macedon.
4 Establishing buffer zones: Through his conquests and alliances, Philip II sought to create buffer zones around Macedon. By controlling key regions and city-states, he could protect Macedon's borders and prevent potential invasions or attacks from hostile neighbors.

Hegemon (ἡγεμών):
* Etymology: The word "hegemon" is derived from the Greek verb "hēgeisthai" (ἡγεῖσθαι), meaning "to lead" or "to guide."
* Meaning: In the context of the League of Corinth, the term "hegemon" referred to the leader or commander of the allied forces. The hegemon was responsible for organizing and leading the military campaigns of the league. It was a position of leadership and authority, but not necessarily one of absolute rule.
* Philip II's role: As the hegemon of the League of Corinth, Philip II was recognized as the leader of the Greek city-states in matters of common defense and foreign policy. He had the authority to make decisions on behalf of the league, but he was not an absolute monarch over the member states.

⠀Emperor:
* Greek term: The Greeks did not have a specific term that directly corresponds to the modern concept of an emperor. However, they used the word "basileus" (βασιλεύς) to refer to a king or a monarch with significant power and authority.
* Persian kings: The Greeks often referred to the Persian kings as "megas basileus" (μέγας βασιλεύς), meaning "great king" or "king of kings." This title emphasized the vast power and territory controlled by the Persian monarchs.
* Comparison: The Persian "megas basileus" had more absolute power over their subjects than the Greek "hegemon." The Persian kings were considered divine rulers with complete authority over their empire, while the Greek hegemon's power was more limited and based on the consent of the member states.

⠀Tyrant (τύραννος):
* Etymology: The word "tyrant" is derived from the Greek "tyrannos" (τύραννος), which originally referred to an absolute ruler who had seized power through unconstitutional means.
* Meaning: In ancient Greece, a tyrant was a ruler who gained power through force or popularity, often overthrowing the existing government. Tyrants were not necessarily oppressive or cruel; some were known for their benevolent rule and popular support.
* Comparison: Unlike a tyrant, Philip II's position as hegemon was not gained through unconstitutional means. He was elected to the position by the member states of the League of Corinth, and his authority was based on the agreement of the league, rather than on absolute power.

Cavalry and the hetairoi:
* In Macedon, Philip II reorganized the cavalry and created the hetairoi (companions), an elite cavalry unit drawn from the Macedonian nobility. The hetairoi served as a professional standing army and were directly loyal to the king.
* In contrast, most Greek city-states relied on citizen-soldiers who were called up for military service as needed. They did not have professional standing armies, and their cavalry units were often smaller and less influential than the infantry.

⠀Centralization of power:
* Philip II centralized power in Macedon by reducing the influence of the nobility and making them more dependent on the king. He did this by granting them positions in the hetairoi and the royal court, thereby tying their interests and loyalties to the monarchy.
* In Greek city-states, particularly in democracies like Athens, power was more decentralized. Aristocrats and wealthy citizens could wield significant influence through their participation in political institutions and their ability to fund military campaigns or sponsor public works.

⠀Military bureaucracy:
* Philip II created a more organized and efficient military bureaucracy in Macedon. He appointed officials to oversee various aspects of the army, such as logistics, training, and recruitment. This allowed for a more consistent and effective military force.
* Greek city-states had less developed military bureaucracies, and their armies were often organized on an ad hoc basis. This could lead to inconsistencies in training, equipment, and strategy.

⠀Political unity:
* Macedon, as a monarchy with a centralized power structure, was more politically unified than the Greek city-states. Philip II could make decisions and implement policies without the need for extensive debate or consensus-building.
* Greek city-states, on the other hand, were often fiercely independent and had a history of internal conflicts and rivalries. This lack of unity made it difficult for them to coordinate their efforts against external threats like Macedon.

⠀Resistance to Macedonian hegemony:
* The political and military structures of the Greek city-states made it challenging for them to resist Macedonian expansion effectively. Their decentralized power structures, citizen-soldier armies, and lack of unity hindered their ability to mount a coordinated defense against Philip II's professional army and centralized leadership.
* Moreover, some Greek city-states, such as Thebes and Athens, had suffered significant losses in the Battle of Chaeronea (338 BCE), which weakened their ability to resist Macedonian hegemony.

Tensions at the wedding, Alexander and Olympias go into exile

The situation you described highlights the complex dynastic politics and tensions within the Macedonian royal family during the reign of Philip II, which posed a potential threat to Alexander's position as heir to the throne.

Despite being raised as the presumed heir, Alexander's succession was not entirely secure. In 337 BCE, Philip married a Macedonian noblewoman named Cleopatra Eurydice, who was the niece of Attalus, a powerful Macedonian general and ally of Philip. This marriage had significant implications for Alexander's future:

1. Threat of a new heir: If Philip were to have a child with Cleopatra, especially a male heir, it could jeopardize Alexander's claim to the throne. A child born to a Macedonian mother from an influential family like Attalus' would have strong support within the Macedonian nobility.

2. Full-blooded Macedonian heir: Alexander's mother, Olympias, was from Epirus, a neighboring kingdom. Some Macedonian nobles might have preferred a future king with purely Macedonian blood. A child born to Philip and Cleopatra would have been seen as a more "legitimate" heir by those who held this view.

3. Attalus' opposition to Alexander: Attalus, Cleopatra's uncle, was known to be hostile towards Alexander. He may have seen Alexander as a threat to his own influence and the potential power of any children born to his niece and Philip.

During the wedding feast of Philip and Cleopatra, tensions came to a head. Attalus allegedly made a toast, praying for a "legitimate" heir to the Macedonian throne, implying that Alexander was not a suitable successor. An enraged Alexander responded by throwing his cup at Attalus. Philip, also drunk, drew his sword and charged at Alexander, but stumbled and fell. Alexander then mocked his father, saying, "Here is the man who was making ready to cross from Europe to Asia, and who cannot even cross from one table to another without losing his balance."

This incident, along with the growing tensions between Philip and Alexander, led to Alexander and his mother Olympias going into exile. Alexander went to Illyria, while Olympias returned to her native Epirus.

Although Philip later reconciled with Alexander and brought him back to the Macedonian court, the threat posed by Cleopatra and any potential children remained. The complex web of dynastic politics, rivalries, and alliances within the Macedonian nobility made Alexander's position as heir less than completely secure, despite his being groomed for the role from a young age.

* Alexander first marched north to subdue the Thracians, a group of tribes that inhabited the region northeast of Macedon. He quickly defeated the Thracians and forced them to acknowledge Macedonian rule.
* Next, he turned his attention to the Illyrians and Taulantii, tribes that lived along the Adriatic coast. In a swift campaign, Alexander conquered these tribes, securing Macedon's western border.
* He then marched east to deal with the Triballi, a powerful tribe in the region of modern-day Serbia. Alexander defeated the Triballi in a fierce battle near the Danube River, demonstrating his military prowess.

Theban Revolt (335 BCE):
* While Alexander was campaigning in the Balkans, the Greek city-state of Thebes revolted against Macedonian rule, encouraged by false rumors of Alexander's death.
* Alexander quickly marched south to Thebes and besieged the city. After a fierce battle, he conquered Thebes and ordered the city to be destroyed, sparing only the temples and the house of the poet Pindar.
* The destruction of Thebes served as a warning to other Greek city-states, discouraging further revolts against Macedonian authority.

2 He summarizes major events like Philip II's death, Alexander's succession at around age 20, his securing of leadership of the Greek campaign against Persia, some initial rebellions in Greek cities, and Alexander's return to Macedon to prepare for the Asian expedition.
3 Arrian then narrates Alexander's campaign against the Thracians, Triballi and Illyrians in 335 BC to secure his northern borders before embarking for Asia.
4 The account is concise, sequential, and focused on military and political actions, with little anecdotal material. Arrian aims to provide a straightforward historical record.

⠀In contrast, Plutarch's Life of Alexander includes more anecdotes and focuses on Alexander's character and lineage:
1 Plutarch opens by explaining his approach in writing biography - to reveal character through smaller details and sayings, not just great deeds.
2 He discusses Alexander's ancestry and divine lineage from Heracles and Aeacus.
3 He relates stories about omens, dreams and legends surrounding Alexander's birth and conception - Olympias dreaming of a thunderbolt striking her womb, Philip dreaming of sealing her womb with the image of a lion, a snake lying beside Olympias, implying divine parentage.
4 Plutarch includes variants of these stories and Olympias' enthusiastic Bacchic religious practices, presenting Alexander's birth as supernaturally foretold.
5 The focus is on omens, character, and the formation of Alexander's heroic persona from birth.

⠀So in summary, Arrian provides a more conventional historical narrative focused on fact and event, while Plutarch includes colorful biographical details to illuminate Alexander's origins and character, in line with their different aims as historian versus biographer. But both see Alexander as an extraordinary figure whose early life held portents of future greatness.

The Achaemenid Empire, also known as the First Persian Empire, was a major ancient civilization that existed from around 550 BCE to 330 BCE. Here's a brief overview of its history from Cyrus the Great to Darius III:

1. Cyrus the Great (c. 550-530 BCE):
   - Founded the Achaemenid Empire by uniting Persian tribes and conquering the Median Empire.
   - Expanded the empire by conquering Lydia, Babylon, and parts of Central Asia.
   - Known for his tolerant policies towards conquered peoples and religions.

2. Cambyses II (530-522 BCE):
   - Son and successor of Cyrus the Great.
   - Conquered Egypt and added it to the empire.
   - Died under mysterious circumstances during a revolt led by a usurper claiming to be his brother, Bardiya.

3. Darius I (522-486 BCE):
   - Took the throne after overthrowing the usurper Bardiya.
   - Expanded the empire to its greatest extent, including parts of Greece, Thrace, and the Indus Valley.
   - Reorganized the empire into satrapies (provinces) for better administration and taxation.
   - Codified laws and initiated major construction projects, such as the capital city of Persepolis.

4. Xerxes I (486-465 BCE):
   - Son and successor of Darius I.
   - Known for his massive invasion of Greece, which ended in the Persian defeat at the Battle of Salamis (480 BCE).
   - Suppressed revolts in Egypt and Babylon.
   - Assassinated in a court conspiracy.

5. Artaxerxes I to Darius III (465-330 BCE):
   - The empire began to decline due to internal struggles, court intrigues, and revolts in satrapies.
   - Faced the growing threat of the Macedonian kingdom under Philip II and his son, Alexander the Great.
   - Darius III, the last Achaemenid king, was defeated by Alexander the Great in the battles of Issus (333 BCE) and Gaugamela (331 BCE).
   - The Achaemenid Empire fell to Alexander the Great in 330 BCE, marking the end of the Persian dynasty and the beginning of the Hellenistic era.

The Achaemenid Empire, known for its vast size, efficient administration, and cultural diversity, left a lasting legacy in the regions it once controlled. Its fall to Alexander the Great paved the way for the spread of Hellenistic culture throughout the Near East and beyond.

The Achaemenid Empire was a vast, centralized, and diverse empire that relied on a combination of strategies to maintain its power and control over its territories. Let's examine the empire through the lens of the topics you mentioned:

1. Center and Periphery:
   - The empire had a strong central authority, with the king and his court at the center of power, usually residing in one of the royal capitals like Persepolis, Susa, or Ecbatana.
   - The periphery consisted of numerous satrapies (provinces) that were governed by satraps appointed by the king.

2. Tax and Tribute:
   - The empire relied on a well-organized taxation system to fund its administration, military, and royal projects.
   - Satrapies were required to pay annual tributes to the central treasury, which could be in the form of precious metals, goods, or military resources.

3. Connectivity:
   - The Achaemenids invested in infrastructure, including an extensive network of roads, such as the Royal Road, which facilitated communication, trade, and military movement across the empire.
   - The use of official languages, particularly Aramaic, helped maintain administrative coherence.
   - The quote you are referring to is from Herodotus' Histories, Book 8, passage 98. The exact quote is: "Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds."

4. Satrapies:
   - The empire was divided into satrapies, each governed by a satrap who was responsible for maintaining order, collecting taxes, and providing military support to the king.
   - Satraps enjoyed considerable autonomy in their provinces but were subject to oversight by the central government through the "eyes and ears of the king" (royal inspectors).
   - Satraps have local armies (like a militia) 
   - The first armies Alexander encounters are those of satraps

5. Military:
   - But also there was a royal army
   - The Achaemenid military was known for its diverse composition, including Persians, Medes, and troops from various subject nations.
   - The elite Persian unit, known as the "Immortals," served as the king's personal guard and a standing army.

6. Pragmatism and Local Circumstances:
   - The Achaemenids were pragmatic in their approach to governing conquered territories, often allowing local customs, religions, and elites to persist as long as they did not threaten Persian authority.
   - This flexibility helped maintain stability and loyalty among the empire's diverse subjects.

7. Diversity and Achaemenid Culture:
   - The empire was characterized by significant cultural, linguistic, and religious diversity.
   - While the Achaemenids promoted Persian culture and the Zoroastrian faith, they also tolerated and even supported local traditions and beliefs.

8. Royal Ideology:
   - Achaemenid kings portrayed themselves as chosen by the supreme god Ahura Mazda to rule over a vast, divinely-ordained empire.
   - Royal inscriptions and iconography emphasized the king's role as a just, benevolent ruler and the maintainer of order and peace.

9. Royal Women:
   - Royal women, particularly the queen mother and the king's principal wife, held influential positions in the Achaemenid court. (In contrast to Athenian women)
   - They could own property, participate in diplomatic activities, and exercise significant influence over the king and court politics.
   - Lots of scheming royal women in greek sources

The Achaemenid Empire was a centralized, bureaucratic state that relied on a combination of Persian leadership, local cooperation, and military power to maintain its vast territories. Its success stemmed from its ability to efficiently administer a diverse empire while allowing for a degree of local autonomy and cultural expression.
